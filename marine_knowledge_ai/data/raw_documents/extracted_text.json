\n1.1.1 DOs \n1.1.1.1 DOs on Operation \n Make sure to attach safety and protective devices to the package unit. \n The safety devices and protection systems must be regularly checked for their normal \noperation. \n If any safety device or protection system does not function normally or this product operates in \nan abnormal manner, immediately stop the wo rk and contact your supervisor. When the \nsystem is to be restarted, you must observe the decision and instruction of the supervisor. \n If this product has stopped operation due to an unknown cause, immediately contact your \nsupervisor. Before restarting the system, you mu st seek the decision and instruction of the \nsupervisor. \n Depending on the type of refrigerant used, its leakage may generate a bad smell or poisonous \ngas. Be sure to sufficiently ventilate the room while the machine is operated. \n Regarding the characteristics of the refrigerant and lubricant, e.g., corrosiveness, degradability, \nand toxicity, be sure to obtain the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) of them and follow the instructions \ngiven. \n When this product is not to be used for some period of time, close the suction (side) and \ndischarge (side) stop valves and shut off t he motor power source, heater power, and control \npower. \n1.1.1.2 DOs on Maintenance \n Prepare work procedures based on a work plan. Be sure to perform danger forecasting before \nstarting the work.  \n If two or more people are to work together, be sure to mutually check the work details and \nprocedures before the work. During the work, alwa ys keep track of the other workers’ actions.  \n Before working on any troubleshooting during o peration, before setting up this product, before \ncleaning work, and before conducting maintenance or  inspection work, be sure to shut off the \nmotor power source, control power, and power to other equipment, perform lock-out and \ntag-out procedures, and take effective measures  to prevent any accidental power-on during \nthe work.  \n Before working on any troubleshooting during o peration, before setting up this product, before \ncleaning work, and before conducting maintenance or inspection work, be sure to check that the internal pressure of this product and t he refrigeration/cold storage unit is at the \natmospheric pressure.  \n Depending on the type of refrigerant used, it may generate a bad smell or poisonous gas or \ncould cause an oxygen deficient atmosphere. Before starting the work, measure the oxygen content in the work area, as appropriate, and provide sufficient ventilation. The ventilation \nmust be continued steadily until the work is completed.  \n For the properties of refrigerant and lubricant (corrosiveness, decomposab ility or toxicity), be \nsure to obtain the Safety Data Sheet (S DS) and follow the relevant information.  \n After work, the tools used must be returned to the predefined location.

The lock-out/tag-out after power down is a very \neffective means to ensure the safety when two or more workers are working on the system at \nthe same time, as it can prevent possible injury  of workers that may be caused by accidental \npower-on of the driving sour ce by one of the workers.  \n If there is a risk of danger, especially during cleaning, maintenance/inspection, or \ntroubleshooting work, be sure to let the workers perform the lock-out/tag-out procedures after \nthe motor main power and control power has been shut off.  \n Because the workers may neglect to perform the lock-out/tag-out procedures or cut-off the \npower in the following situations, be sure to instruct them to strictly follow the correct \nprocedure by clearly identifying t he work that require lock-out/tag -out and the reasons why it is \nneeded. \n As it is a cumbersome task for the workers to cut off the motor main power and control \npower and use lock-out/tag-out devices before starting the work, they might neglect to do \nit. \n The workers might determine by themselves that  it should be OK just to cut off the motor \nmain power and control power, and not use any lock-out/tag-out devices. \n1.1.1.4 DOs about Pers onal Protective Gear \n Prepare and use protective gear complying with the safety standards of the regulations. \n Check the function of each protective gear before using. \n Wear designated clothes such as work outfits, with their cuffs tightly closed. \n Do not wear any neckties or jewelry as there is  a risk of being entangled by a movable part or \nrotating part. Put on a helmet as your hair may get entangled. \n Do not have anything in your pocket to pr event objects from falling into the machine. \n1.1.1.5 DOs about Handling of Ha zardous and Toxic Substances \n Obtain Safety Data Sheet (SDS) from manufacturers of hazardous and toxic substances. \nCheck the MSDS and follow the handling instru ctions recommended by the manufacturers to \nhandle and store those substances. \n1.1.1.6 DOs about Handling Emergency Situations \n Formulate an emergency action plan complying with the regulations, and post it on a safe \nplace. \n1.1.1.7 DOs about Waste Oi l, Fluid, and Materials \n Disposing of refrigerant and oil used for this pr oduct are subject to a number of regulations for \nthe environmental protection purposes. Follow the local, state, federal acts and regulations \nand your company's rules when disposing of such waste oil, fluid and materials. \n1.1.1.8 Other DOs \n Keep clean the floor around the entire package unit. Provide a safety passage. \n Walk only on the areas set up as a work floor. Also, do not leave tools and cleaning solutions \nin that area. \n If water or oil is spilled on this product or the floor, immediately wipe it off to prevent workers \nfrom slipping and getting injured. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 1 Safety \nScrew Compressor i-series 1.2 Warnings  \n1-3  \n1.1.2 DON'Ts \n Do not remove or relocate any safety device, including electrical interfaces. \n Do not disable any safety device by short- circuiting or bypassing without any permission. \n Do not leave this product unsafe and unattended, by removing a safety cover or some other \nmeasures. \n Do not touch, clean or lubricate any part of this product which is moving. \n Do not touch relays or electr ic systems such as terminal block with bare hands when turning \non the power. \n \n \n1.2 Warnings \nThe following two measures are taken for this product  to let workers pay attention to possible dangers. \n Warnings described in this manual \n Safety labels affixed on the equipment main body \n* No safety labels are affixed to the compressor itself which this manual is intended for. \nFor details about the warning labels affixed to  the package unit, refer to the instruction \nmanual of the unit. \n \n \n1.2.1 Warning Notices in this Manual \nThe warning messages described in this manual warn  dangerous situations that  may arise during work \nby using the following four categories. \nNeglecting such warnings may cause accidents,  resulting in personal injury or even death. \nAlso, this product or its auxiliary equipment ma y be heavily damaged.

It has features of \nboth reciprocating and centrifugal compressors. \nAs shown in Figure 2-14, the refrigerant (gas) is continuously compressed by the 3-dimensional spaces \nthat are formed by a pair of male and female scre w rotors (with different sectional profiles) and the \ncasing, as the spaces change continuously. The rotor having 4 protruding tooth profiles is called a male or M rotor, and the rotor having 6 concave \nprofiles is called a female or F rotor. In this manual, they are referred to as M rotor and F rotor. \nThe compressor is driven by the motor connected to the shaft of the M rotor. \n \nFigure 2-14 Compressor Mechanism \n \n \n2.5.2 Suction Process \nAs shown in Figure 2-15, the rotors with different tooth profiles are engaged. As the rotors turn, the \nvolume between the M and F rotor tooth profiles and the compressor casing gradually increases starting \nfrom the suction side. \nAs the rotation continues, at a certain point when the volume reaches its maximum, the rotors isolate the \ngas (volume), which is enclosed by the rotors and t he compressor casing, from the suction port and then \ncontinues rotation. \n \n \nFigure 2-15 Suction Process \n2200M4-JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 2 Compressor Specifications and Configuration \nScrew Compressor i-series  2.5 Mechanisms  \n2-25  \n \n2.5.3 Compression Process \nAs the rotors rotate further, the volume between t he rotor teeth and grooves decreases while the sealing \nline moves toward the discharge side, which compresses the trapped refrigerant gas. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.5.4 Discharge Process \nThe volume between the rotor teeth and grooves de creases to a level predetermined by the discharge \nport. With the rotations of the rotors, the compressed re frigerant gas is pushed out to the discharge port. \n \n2.5.5 About Volume Ratio (Vi)  \nVolume ratios (Vi) are indicated in property tables or \ncatalogs by using port symbols L, M and H. \nThe volume ratio represented by each symbol  (          screw compressor) is as follows:  \nL=2.63, M=3.65, H=5.80. \n \nVolume of suctioned refrigerant gas immediately before the start of compression  Vi =  \n      V o l u m e  o f  r e f r i g erant gas just before pushed \n    out to discharge port   \nDecide which volume ratio (L, M or H ) should be used \naccording to operating conditions. If the compressor is \nused with a volume ratio that does not match operating \nconditions, operation will go inefficiently wasting the power.  The relationship between volume ratios and generally  \nused compression ratios is as follows: \n  \n \n \n \n(Vi）\nκ＝ πi ＝ Pｄ/Ps        κ = Cp/Cv of ref rigerant gas \n Vi = Design volume ratio   πi  = Design compression ratio \n \nVi is related to the specific heat ratio ( κ) and therefore its value relative to the compression ratio varies \ndepending on the type of refrigerant gas. \nFigure 2-16 Compression Process  \nFigure 2-17 Discharge Process\nFigure 2-18 Volume Ratio \n2200M4-JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 2 Compressor Specifications and Configuration \nScrew Compressor i-series  2.5 Mechanisms  \n2-26  \n  (A)  Properly adapted Vi to load condition \nBoth the required compression ratio and Vi are low.          Both the required compression ratio and Vi are high. \n \n \n(B)  Improperly adapted Vi to load condition \n \nToo low Vi compared with necessary compression ratio.

Make \nsure that the work is performed by qualified personnel in compliance with local laws, \nordinances and other regulations/requirements. \n Read this chapter and related document s, and fully understand their contents before \nperforming installation. \n Electrical works should be performed only by electrical engineers. \n  \n3.2 Installation Works \n3.2.1 Unpacking \nCheck that there are no abnormalities such as damage on the compressor. \n \n If there are abnormalities or deficient parts on the compressor, please contact one of our local \nsales offices or service centers immediately. \n Unnecessary packing materials should be discarded according to the laws and ordinances, or \nyour company's rules. \n3.2.2 Storage \nPerform the followings to store the compressor before installation. \n Store it indoors. \n Infuse nitrogen gas into the compressor and seal it. (Pressure: approximately 0.15 MPa) \n3.2.3 Transfer \n Should the compressor being lifted up drop, th ere is a high risk of death or severe \ninjury. Provide sufficient protection such that no one can enter an area below a \ncompressor being lifted up.    \n1. For lifting the compressor within the safety lim it, use lifting equipment and tools appropriate for the \nweight of compressor. \n2. Secure sufficient space for safe lifting. \n3. Always check the wire ropes before using them. Thoroughly check the wire ropes for problems \nsuch as kinks, knots and broken strands. Do not  perform lifting work before confirming the safety \nof the wire ropes. If you cannot make a correct evaluation or judgment, entrust an expert to check. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 3 Installation  \nScrew Compressor i-series 3.2 Installation Works  \n3-2  \n4. To lift the compressor, attach the wire rope s to the appended eye bolts by using appropriate \nshackles and hooks. Use the eye bolts only for lifting the compressor.  \n   \nFigure 3-1 Eye bolts for lifting the compressor (Arrows) \n \n The compressor eye bolts must not be used for lifting the unit. To lift the unit, use the \nlifting chains provided around the base or other lifting means provided on the base.    \n5. Check path of compressor installation to make sure it is free of obstacles in consideration of the \ncompressor size. \n6. Before lifting, check that the hook is locat ed above the gravity center of the compressor. \n7. Before starting to lift up the compressor, instruct all the workers to be sufficiently away from the \nlifting area. \n8. Just before starting to lift up, provide the cowork ers with a sign (such as a call, hand signal, etc.) \nof starting the lifting action. Do not start to lift up unless the sign (such as a call, hand signal, etc.) \nhas been fully acknowledged. \n9. Slowly reel up the wire ropes until immediately before the compressor leaves the ground. \n10. Then, reel up the wire ropes a little further until the compressor is slightly up away from the ground. \nCheck that the compressor is not tilted. If the comp ressor is tilted, return the compressor to the \nground and correct the tilt by adjusting the wire ropes. After that, restart the lifting operation. \n11. Be sure to lift up the compressor slowly. If it is lifted rapidly, it may damage the lifting tools such as \nwire ropes or a part of the compressor. \n12. When the lifting work starts, observe to see if wire ropes and lifting tools are normal. Be sure that \nthe compressor is not tilted. \n13. When moving the lifted compressor, always use guiding ropes. \n14. When moving the compressor, turn away workers from the movement direction and check safety. \n15. Do not lift the compressor above the safety passage unless absolutely necessary. \n16. Do not lower the compressor on the safety passage. Always keep the safety passage free of \nobstacles. \n17. Remove any obstacles before lowering the compressor onto the ground. The compressor should \nnot be tilted or unstable. \n18. Before lowering the compressor, announce to the workers around the working area in advance. \n19. When lowering the compressor onto two or more blocks, align the tops of blocks so that the \ncompressor becomes stable horizontally on them. \n20. Slowly lower the lifted compressor so that it is not damaged by shock. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 3 Installation  \nScrew Compressor i-series 3.2 Installation Works  \n3-3 3.2.4 Preparation for Installation \n Installation Space \nSecure sufficient working space for easy operation, cleaning, maintenance, and inspection. \n Lighting \nProvide sufficient lighting to allow easy oper ation, cleaning, maintenance, and inspection. \n Ventilation \nIf natural ventilation is insufficient, install ventila tion fans according to the relevant regulations. \n Piping \nRefer to the relevant figures section 2.3.4\"Outer Dimensions\" in this manual. \n \n3.2.5 Installation \nCheck that the surface of the pa ckage unit, where the compressor is to be installed, is even and \nhorizontal. If it is uneven and non-horizontal, tightening the bolts may lead to compressor deformation, \nwhich may prevent normal operation. \n3.2.5.1 Piping Connection \n Refrigerant Piping \nObserve the following when connecting the refrigerant piping. \n The compressor is one of the few devices installed within the refrigerating/cold storage unit that \nhave moving components. These moving compone nts are adversely affected by foreign \nsubstances within the system (scale, dust, spatter,  etc.). Therefore, when connecting the piping, \ndo not allow any of such foreign substances to enter inside.  \n Some compressors (mainly those for export) ar e charged with nitrogen gas to prevent rust. Be \nsure to release the pressure before starting piping work. \n Be sure not to allow moisture to enter the pipi ng. There is a high prob ability that it will cause \ntrouble after the start of operation. Be sure to assemble piping when it is dry. \n Improper piping may cause operating problems such as oil not returning to the compressor or \nliquid flow-backs. \n When connecting the piping to the compressor, use piping that is the same size as the \ncompressor connection port. If the pipe size of the piping is smaller than the compressor connection port, the flow of lubricant or refr igerant will be obstructed leading to problems. \n Do not let the weight of the piping connected to the compressor applied onto flanges or joints. \nBe sure to prepare proper supports for piping. \n3.2.5.2 Equipment and Devices for Protection of the Compressor \n Oil Filter \nUse an oil filter with filtrati on accuracy of not higher than 15 μm and install it in front of the oil inlet of \nthe compressor. \nThe oil filter may be clogged just after test operation. We recommend installing two oil filters in \nparallel. This will enable replacement of either filter during operation. \n Oil Heater for Oil Separator \nTo preserve the temperature of the lubricant before starting the compressor operation, install an oil heater on the oil separator. In cold districts, install a band heater to the oil supply piping. \nMake sure to install a protection function (thermo stat, etc.) to the heater to prevent overheating. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 3 Installation  \nScrew Compressor i-series 3.2 Installation Works  \n3-4  \n Suction Strainer \nWhen miscible oil is used, the mesh size of suction strainer should be not less than 200 meshes. \nWhen non-miscible oil is used, it should be not less than 100 meshes. \nFor details about miscible and non-miscible oils, refe r to section 4.1 \"Lubricant  (Refrigerant Oil)\" in \nthis manual. \nDuring commissioning, small particles and scale may come from the system. We recommend to \ninstall a finer filter temporarily. \n Line Filter for Economizer/Aquamizer (Liquid injection) \nWhen using an economizer or/and aquamizer (liquid in jection), install a filter with filtration accuracy \nof not higher than 100 μm within the line. \n Compressor Protective Devices (Safety Devices) \nInstall the necessary protective devices, referring to  section 1.4.3 \"Compresso r Protective Devices\" \nand section 2.3.3 \"Alarm Setting Values\", in this manual. \n \n3.2.6 Airtightness Test \nBefore commissioning, perform an airtightness test on the refrigerating/cold storage package unit. \nUse the design pressure of the refrigerating unit as t he test pressure. Keep that pressure for at least 30 \nminutes, and perform a leak test on the connecting/jointing parts like flanges by using leakage \ndetection liquid (soapy water, etc.). \n \n3.2.7 Lubricant Charge \n In the packaging of the refrigerating unit, in stall two valves at the front and the rear of \nan oil filter. Install an oil charge port between the oil filter and the upstream side valve. \n When refilling lubricant, ensure that it is  clean and does not contain foreign matters. \n Be careful that air and water are not mixed in when refilling. \n To ensure that the lubricant does not absorb air moisture, keep it indoors in an airtight \ncontainer until use.   \n3.2.7.1 Initial Charge of Lubricant \nAt initial commissioning or after periodical inspection,  the compressor's moving parts such as bearings \nand mechanical seals may not be sufficiently lubricated. So, charge the compressor with lubricant \naccording to the following procedure. \n1. Thoroughly evacuate the compressor and oil separator (approximately 40 Torr). \n2. Open the downstream side valve of the oil filter , and charge 10 liters of lubricant from the oil \nsupply port. \n3. Turn the compressor's rotor shaft.  \n4. Close the downstream side valve of the oil filter. \n5. Open the upstream side valve of the oil filter, and charge lubricant to the oil separator until it \nreaches the specified level. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 3 Installation  \nScrew Compressor i-series 3.2 Installation Works  \n3-5  \n \n Be sure to conduct the initial charge of lubricant in such a way that the oil cooler and oil filter are \nfilled with lubricant. \n For details about lubricant to be used, refer to section 4.1 \"Lubricant (Ref rigerant Oil)\" in this \nmanual. \n For the amount of initial charge of lubricant, refer to the instruction manual of the package unit. \n \n3.2.7.2 Additional Charge of Lubricant \nFor additional charge of lubricant during operation,  follow the procedure described in the instruction \nmanual of each package unit. The applicable procedure differs among units and operating conditions. \n \n3.2.8 Charge of Refrigerant \nCharge refrigerant, referring to the refrigerating/cold storage package unit instruction manual. \n \n3.2.9 Check after Installation \nCheck the compressor after installation according to  the check items of the re frigerating/cold storage \npackage unit  \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 4 Operation of Compressor and Unit  \nScrew Compressor i-se ries 4.1 Lubricant (Refrigerant Oil)  \n4-1 Chapter 4  Operation of Compressor and Unit \n \n4.1 Lubricant (Refrigerant Oil) \nLubrication management is very significant to k eep the compressor in a good operating condition. \nTake the following notes when managing lubricant. \n \n4.1.1 Precautions for Selecting the Lubricant \n Selection of the lubrication oil should depend on the type of the refrigerant, the type of the \nevaporator used with the compressor, and the co nditions under which the compressor is \noperated. Also to be considered when selecting lubr ication oil are the properties of the oil that \ninclude not only the viscosity but also such characteristics as sol ubility in refrigerant, \nseparability from refrigerant, low temperature fl uidity, high temperature thermal stability, etc. \nWe therefore recommend to contact our sales of fices or MAYEKAWA representative for choice \nof a specified brand for your system.  \n Lubrication oil used for compressors must have a viscosity appropriate for lubricating the \nbearings and other components in the compressors. The viscosity to be considered in this \ncase should be the viscosity the o il shows at the oil inlet of the compressor. The viscosity of \nlubrication oil significantly changes dependi ng on the type of the refrigerant used in \ncombination with the oil. If the refrigerant dissolves in the oil (or the oil and refrigerant are inter-soluble), the viscosity of the oil drops to  a level remarkably below the level required for \noperation of the compressor under some oper ating conditions. On the contrary, if the \nrefrigerant does not dissolve in the oil (or t he oil and refrigerant are non-inter-soluble), the \nviscosity may become too high when the supply oil temperature is low. For this reason, the lubricant must be selected such that it is supplied to the compressor with an appropriate \nviscosity (kinematic viscosity of 13 - 40 mm\n2/s) in the operating state. \n \n The circulation of the lubricant for the entire system must be considered. After lubricating and \ncooling each part of the compressor, the lubric ant is discharged with refrigerant gas. Most of \nthe oil which is discharged from this compressor is trapped by the oil separator and is cycled to the compressor. A small quantity of refrigerant  oil goes to the condenser and the evaporator. \nThe lubricant is required to have sufficient fl uidity and stability inside parts with different \ntemperatures. \n \n Be careful since polyolester synthetic oil (POE) cannot be used with ammonia \n refrigerant.  \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 4 Operation of Compressor and Unit  \nScrew Compressor i-se ries 4.1 Lubricant (Refrigerant Oil)  \n4-2 4.1.2 Recommended Lubricants \nWhen selecting lubricant, not only compatibility with refrigerant but also effe cts on O-rings must be \nconsidered.

Types of \nadditives and their mixing ratio depend on each oil brand. We, therefore, recommend to avoid \nmixed use of different brands of lubricant. If mi xed brands of lubricant are used, the different \nadditives in the lubricant may react with each other and produce foreign substances like slurry.  \n If it is necessary to change the brand of lubrican t, collect as much as oil as possible from the \ncompressor as well as from the condenser, evaporator, and all other refrigerating unit \ncomponents before charging the new lubricant. Af ter 100 to 200 hours of operation, replace \nthe oil again. \n If lubricant manufacturers differ, contact both of them and inquire whether the changing is \nappropriate. The same confirmation is required for changing the brand even if it is of the same \nmanufacturer. \n There is no problem in changing the viscosity le vel within the same brand. However, make \nsure that the viscosity grade will not cause problems during operation. (Example: SUNISO \n3GS→SUNISO 4GS)    \n4.1.4 Precautions for Handling Lubricant \n When refilling lubricant, ensure that it is clean and does not contain foreign matters. \n Be careful that air and water are not mixed in when refilling. \n To ensure that the lubricant does not absor b air moisture, keep it indoors in an airtight \ncontainer until use. \n For management of lubricant, refer to \"5.3 Management of Lubricant\" in this manual. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 4 Operation of Compressor and Unit  \nScrew Compressor i-series 4.2 Precautions for Operation  \n4-4 4.2 Precautions for Operation \n4.2.1 Prevention of Liquid Flow-back \nLiquid flow-back is a phenomenon where refrigerant that did not completely  evaporate with the gas \nreaches the compressor. Liquid flow-back may caus e insufficient lubrication of the compressor, \nabnormal vibrations and noises, and abnormal foaming of  lubricant (too much entry of oil). To prevent \nliquid flow-back, properly adjust the ex pansion valve of each liquid cooler.  \nFor details, refer to \"Troubleshooting\" in chapter 6 of this manual. \n4.2.2 Purging of Non-Condensable Gases \n \n Some types of refrigerants emit bad smells or toxic gases. Make sure to ventilate \nthe air during work. \n \nIf there is a leak on the low-pressure side of the unit, air may enter the unit. \nIf non-condensable gas like air enters the unit, the condensing pressure rises and the energy \nconsumption increases. This leads to uneconomical operation. \nFollow the procedure below to check for non-condensable gases. \n \n1. When the compressor is stopped, allow the cooling water to flow to the unit's condenser for at \nleast 15 minutes. Check the condensing pressure by using the pressure gauge of the compressor.  \n2. Check the cooling water temperature.  \n3. Compare the condensing pressure checked in step 1 above with the refrigerant saturation \npressure that depends on the cooling water temperature (as shown in Table 4-1).   \n4. When the pressure inside the condenser and the re frigerant saturation pressure that depends on \nthe cooling water temperature are approximatel y equivalent, non-condensable gases do not exist. \nWhen the pressure inside the condenser is 0.05 MPa or more higher than the refrigerant \nsaturation pressure that depends on the cooling water temperature, there is a possibility of \nnon-condensable gases entering the unit. In that  case, purge the non-condensable gases from \nthe condenser.  \nTable 4-1 Typical Refrigerant Temperature and Saturation Pressure \nTemperature °C Pressure MPa *1 \nAmmonia R404A R507A R134a \n0 0.328 0.509 0.523 0.192 \n4 0.396 0.590 0.606 0.237 \n8 0.472 0.678 0.696 0.287 \n12 0.557 0.775 0.795 0.342 \n16 0.652 0.881 0.903 0.403 \n20 0.756 0.996 1.021 0.471 \n24 0.871 1.121 1.148 0.545 \n28 0.998 1.256 1.286 0.626 \n32 1.137 1.401 1.435 0.714 \n36 1.289 1.559 1.595 0.811 \n40 1.454 1.728 1.768 0.916 \n \n   *1: Unless otherwise noted, the pressure unit MPa represents the gauge pressure in this manual. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 4 Operation of Compressor and Unit  \nScrew Compressor i-series 4.2 Precautions for Operation  \n4-5  \n4.2.3 Action for Stopping the Co mpressor for Long Period of Time \n \nWhen stopping the compressor for a long period of time, conduct the following: \n Turn off the motor main power. \n Turn off the heater power and control panel power. \n Close the suction and discharge side shut-off valves. \n \nWhen the compressor is stopped for more than a month, conduct the following once a month: \n Measure the unit pressure. \n Check for refrigerant leakage. \n Do the procedure described in this manual Chapter 3, section 3.2.7.1. \n \n \nWhen restarting the compressor which has been stopped for more than a year, check for the leakage of \nrefrigerant and replace the oil. Also measure the insulation resistance of the motor. \nSupply power to the oil heater at leas t an hour before starting operation.  \nBefore starting operation, check that refrigerant is not condensed inside the package unit based on the \ntemperature and pressure inside the package unit. \n \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.1 Precautions for Maintenance and Inspection  \n5-1 Chapter 5  Maintenance and Inspection \n \n5.1 Precautions for Maintenance and Inspection \n Before starting maintenance/inspection work after completely recovering the refrigerant from \nthe unit, make sure that the main motor power, control power and power for instruments and \nvalves are turned off and that the turned-off switches are protected from any unauthorized \naccess. In addition, attach a notification tag to inform other workers that the turned-off \nswitches must not be turned on (lockout/tagout). \n Also when a manual valve is closed, take proper actions so that it cannot be operated by other \nworkers and attach a notification tag stating that the device must not be opened (tagout). \n When disassembling, inspecting or handling the compressor, be sure to fully understand the \nprocedures before starting the work. This manual does not provide complete procedures for disassembly and assembly of the compressor. It just explains the points for servicing the \ncompressor. \n If complete assembly and disassembly of the compressor has to be done, consult our local \noffice or service center. \n When replacing any parts of the compressor, use \n genuine parts. If you do not \nuse genuine parts, unexpected problems may occur. \n Do not modify the compressor or any of its parts without MAYEKAWA's permission. It may \ncause the compressor to be damaged or disabled from maintaining its normal functions.  \n When disassembling the compressor, remove it from the unit frame and place it on a work \nbench. Before removing the compressor from the unit frame, recover the refrigerant from the \nunit properly and check that the pressure inside the compressor is atmospheric. \n Prior to the removal of the compressor from the unit frame, check that the high temperature \nside (discharge side) is cooled down to at least 40°C or lower. \n Disassemble the compressor on a rigid and flat work bench. \n When removing the compressor from the unit frame and placing it on the work bench, follow \nthe instructions in \"3.1 General Precautions for Installation\" and \"3.2.3 Transfer\" in this \nmanual. \n Do not allow anyone other than qualified personnel  to lift and carry the compressor or the \npackage. \n For compressor disassembly/assembly, use sp ecified tools that are properly functioning. \n When handling heavy objects, exerci se extreme care and use safe auxiliary tools such as stud \nbolts (safety bolts). \n When handling a heavy object, use a crane or other lifting device. Otherwise, the work must \nbe done by at least two people.  \n When working as a team, ensure that all workers have clear underst anding of the work \nprocedure. \n Let qualified personnel turn on/off each power s upply, taking care to avoid electrical shocks. \n Any other electrical or manufacturing work t hat requires qualification must be done by qualified \npersonnel. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.2 Maintenance and Inspection List  \n5-2 5.2 Maintenance and Inspection List \n5.2.1 Daily Management \nAs daily management, check the items listed in Table 5-1 \"Daily Inspection Items\" and record the \nresults. \nBy regularly recording the daily operational data in an operation log, it should be able to detect any \nsignificant change in the system. This is significantly effective in preventing compressor failures. It is particularly important to check whether the temperature/pressure correlations related to the \nrefrigerant evaporation and condensation is proper. Th is makes it possible to quickly find out problems \nin the compressor or the system.  If a failure or accident should occur in the comp ressor or the system, the operation logbook will help \ndetermine the cause and take prompt and proper actions. In addition to the items listed in Table 5-1, it is necessary to record and manage unit components and \nload side conditions on a daily basis.

The table \nbelow lists overhaul intervals recommended by MAYEKAWA which are categorized based on the \ncompressor operating conditions. \n \nTable 5-4 Standard Package Operation Conditions and Overhaul Interval Guidelines \nCategory of operating condition Application exampleRecommended Overhaul \nInterval \nRelatively stable operating condition Refrigeration and cold \nstorage Every 5 years or 40,000 operating hours \nRelatively changing operating condition Ice maker/chiller Every 4 years or 30,000 operating hours \nFrequently started/stopped, and relatively changing operating condition Heat pump Every 3 years or 20,000 operating hours \n \nNote 1: The above guidelines are only applicable when  the compressor is operated within the operation \nlimits specified separately. \n(Refer to section 2.3.2 \"Operation Limits\" in this manual.) \nNote 2: The above guidelines are only applicable when the compressor undergoes daily and periodic \ninspections specif ied separately. \n(Refer to section 5.2.1 \"Daily Management\" in this manual.) \nNote 3: Inspect the compressor at the intervals of  specified period or operating hours, whichever comes \nfirst. \nNote 4: The above guidelines do not constitute any warranty. \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.3 Management of Lubricant  \n5-6 5.3 Management of Lubricant \n5.3.1 Management Criteria \nLubricants, to which the management criteria applies, are classified as follows: \n(1) Mineral oils: Naphthenic base and paraffinic base \n(2) Synthetic oils: Alkyl benzene (AB) and Polyalphaolefine (PAO) (3) Synthetic oils: Polyolesters (POE) \n We recommend performing sampling oil analysis every six months. \n If the following management criteria are not satisfied, replace the oil. \nItems and criteria are as follows. The managem ent criteria may be changed without notice. \n \nTable 5-5 Mineral Oils and Synthetic Oils (AB, PAO)  \nItem Management Criteria \n(a) Color ASTM color standard: 6.0 or less \n(b) Total acid number \n(TAN) Max. 0.3 mg·KOH/g \n(c) Kinematic viscosity Within ±15% in variation when compared with fresh oil \n(d) Water content Max. 100 massppm (See Note 1.) \n(e) Contamination level Max. 15 mg/100 mL as measured by gravimetric (Millipore filter) method \n(See Note 2.) \nTable 5-6 Synthetic Oil (POE)  \nItem Management Criteria \n(a) Color ASTM color standard: 4.0 or less \n(b) Total acid number Max. 0.2 mg·KOH/g \n(c) Kinematic viscosity Within ±10% in variation when compared with fresh oil \n(d) Water content Max. 200 massppm \n(e) Contamination level Max. 15 mg/100 mL as measured by gravimetric (Millipore filter) method \n(See Note 2.)  \nNote 1: Synthetic oils (inter-soluble with ammoni a) are so highly hygrosc opic that they can absorb \nmoisture at the time of sampling. In additi on, the ammonia content they have absorbed may \nbe detected as the water content at the time of  the analysis, making it difficult to precisely \nmeasure the water content. Therefore, use the criterion value only as a reference. \nNote 2: This assumes the use of an oil filter with nominal mesh size at 15 μm or finer. \n \n5.3.2 Lubricant Replacement Interval \n5.3.2.1  First system startup \nWhen the system is started up for the first time, since the lubricant may get contaminated or \ndeteriorated due to scale inside the piping and vessels, sample and analyze the lubricant 500 hours \nafter starting operation. \nIf the results do not meet the management criteria for each oil type detailed in Tables 5-5 / 5-6, replace \nthe lubricant. \n5.3.2.2  During regular operation \nLubricant deteriorates gradually as the system is operated over time. \nThe deterioration rate depends on the operating conditions, oil type, and any foreign substances or \nwater in the oil. \nSample and analyze the lubricant every 6 months  and if the results do not meet the management \ncriteria for each oil type detailed in tables 5-5 and 5-6, replace the lubricant. If oil filters frequently clog \nor the oil has turned dark and unclear, replace oil after removing the cause of problem. \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.4 Compressor Disassembly Preparation  \n5-7  \n5.4 Compressor Disassembly Preparation \nScrew compressors are very reliable compressors. However, it is necessary to disassemble and \ninspect parts after a certain period of operation. This chapter describes the order and method of \ndisassembly, and locations of and methods for inspecting parts.  \nAs a general rule, periodic inspections where the compressor is completely disassembled should be \ndone at the manufacturing factory. At the installation location of the compressor, it is only possible to \ninspect/replace mechanical seals and suction strainers.  \nRead this manual thoroughly and fully understand t he compressor structure as well as the work \nprocedure before starting work. \nNumbers denoted by 【  】that follow part names refer to the numbers used in assembly sectional views \nor development views.   \n \n After turning off the main motor power, control power and the power of each device, \nconduct lockout/tagout to prevent the power from being turned on accidentally \nduring work. \n After closing the suction, discharge and fluid supply shut-off valves, conduct \nlockout/tagout to prevent the valves from being opened accidentally during work. \n The worker who enters the equipm ent should perform lockout/tagout. \n The worker who performed lockout/tagout should release them after checking that all \nwork procedures have completed. \n If refrigerant gas or a mixture of refrigerant and oil remains in the compressor, \nrefrigerant gas may blow off when the clos ed circuit is opened. This may result in \ninjury such as frostbite or loss of vision. Be sure to confirm that there is no residual \npressure before opening any pipe connections. \n  \n5.4.1 Tools for Disassembly and Work Place \n \n For compressor disassembly/assembly, use specified tools that are properly \nfunctioning. Using tools that are worn or da maged or that are unsuitable for the work, \ncan result in injury. \n \nPrepare special hand tools required for disassembly. Refer to \"7.2 List of Tools for Disassembling \ni-Series\" in this manual.  \nIn addition, prepare standard hand tools, green carb onite grinding stone, #80- to #100-grit abrasive \npaper, #800- or finer grit abrasive paper, parts cleani ng oil, lubrication oil, a squirt can, a can for oil \nsump, and a waste cloth. \n \nA work bench with a large surface plate is useful  to perform work accurately and with ease.  \nIf the surface plate cannot be prepar ed, use a commercially available st eel plate. The steel plate should \nbe approximately 1000 mm × 1500 mm in size and have a thickness of approximately 1.5 mm if the \nwork location is flat. \nPerform the work in a dry place with as little sand and dust as possible, with a sufficiently wide space \naround there.  \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.4 Compressor Disassembly Preparation  \n5-8  \n5.4.2 Replacement Parts \n \nPrepare \n  genuine replacement parts.  \nTable 5-7 and table 5-8 are lists of standard parts to be replaced when i-series compressor overhauled.  \nWhen purchasing any part, inform its (a) model, (b) serial number, (c) part name, (d) part code and \n(e) required number  to our sales offices or service centers.  \nThe serial number (b) is especially required among them. Un less serial number is informed, it is difficult \nto identify design and production specification detail s that are needed to identify the part you want to \npurchase. \nTable 5-7 List of replacement parts of i125  \nNo. Part name Code No. Remarks Qty \n6-1 Gasket, Suction Adapter CS00600-I125 i125 1 \n6-2 Gasket, Strainer Cover CS00900-I125 i125 1 \n7 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-140 JIS B 2401 G140 1 \n12 Gasket, Bearing Head CS01200-I125 i125 1 \n17 Gasket, Bearing Cover CS01700-I125 i125 1 \n23 Gasket, End Cover CS02300-I125 i125 t=1.0 1 \n27-1 Radial Bearing CS02800-FM125M FM125M 2 \n27-2 Radial Bearing CS02800-FM125F FM125F 2 \n30 Balance Piston  see Note 2  CS03000-I125 i125 1 \n33 Sleeve, Balance Piston  see Note 2  CS03300-I125 i125 1 \n35 O-ring  see Note 1  PA11-016 JIS B 2401 P16 1 \n38-1 Thrust Bearing M CS03800-I125M i125M 1 \n38-2 Thrust Bearing F CS03800-I125F i125F 1 \n40-1 Lock Washer NG32-008 AW8 1 \n40-2 Lock Washer NG32-009 AW9 1 \n49 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-085 JIS B 2401 G85 1 \n50 Oil Seal  see Note 2  CS05000-125D 125***  Rareflon  1 \n52 Gasket, Seal Cover CS05200-125N 125*** 1 \n100 Mechanical Seal Assembly  see Note 3  CS10002-125EBS BBSE 125*** 1set \n237-1 Torsional Slip Washer M CS23700-F125M FM125 M 1 \n237-2 Torsional Slip Washer F CS23700-125 125L** 1 \n395 Gasket, Unloader Cover CS39500-I160 i160* 2 \n480 Strainer Element  see Note 2  CS48000-I160 i160* 1 \n489 Valve Seat CS48900-I125 i125 1 \n491 Check Valve Shaft  see Note 2  CS49100-I125 i125 1 \n495 O-ring  see Note 1  PA11-007 JIS B 2401 P7 1 \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.4 Compressor Disassembly Preparation  \n5-9  \nTable 5-8 List of replacement parts of i160  \nNo. Part name Code No. Remarks Qty \n6 Gasket, Strainer Cover CS00900-I160 i160 t=0.5 2 \n7-1 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-150 JIS B 2401 G150 1 \n7-2 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-140 JIS B 2401 G140 1 \n12 Gasket, Bearing Head CS01200-I160 i160 t=0.5 1 \n17 Gasket, Bearing Cover CS01700-I160 i160 t=0.5 1 \n23 Gasket, End Cover CS02300-I160N i160 t=1.0 1 \n27-1 Radial Bearing M CS02800-FM160M FM160 2 \n27-2 Radial Bearing F CS02800-FM160F FM160 2 \n30 Balance Piston  see Note 2  CS03000-I160 i160 1 \n33 Sleeve, Balance Piston  see Note 2  CS03300-I160 i160 1 \n35 O-ring  see Note 1  PA11-024 JIS B2401 P24 2 \n38-1 Thrust Bearing M CS03800-I160M 7311B 1 \n38-2 Thrust Bearing F CS03800-I160F 7312B 1 \n40-1 Lock Washer NG32-011 AW11 1 \n40-2 Lock Washer   NG32-012 AW12 1 \n49 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-090 JIS B 2401 G90 1 \n50 Oil Seal  see Note 2  CS05000-160VD 160*** (S55×70×9) 1 \n52 Gasket, Seal Cover CS05200-160N 160*** t=0.5 1 \n93 Gasket, Suction Flange PL300-125 ANSI 300 # 5\" 1 \n96 Gasket, Discharge Flange PL300-080 ANSI 300 # 3\" 1 \n100 Mechanical Seal Assembly  see Note 3  CS10002-160EBS 160V  BBSE 1set \n150-1 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-110 JIS B 2401 G110 1 \n150-2 O-ring  see Note 1  PA12-115 JIS B 2401 G115 1 \n216-2 Flange Gasket, Oil Inlet Port CR72000-025N MYCOM 25A 1 \n237-1 Torsional Slip Washer M CS23700-FM160M FM160 1 \n237-2 Torsional Slip Washer F CS23700-160 160***  1 \n395 Gasket, Unloader Cover CS39500-I160 i160 t=1.0 2 \n480 Strainer Element  see Note 2  CS48000-I160 i160  #150 Φ160×200 1 \n489 Valve Seat CS48900-I160 i160 1 \n491 Check Valve Shaft  see Note 2  CS49100-I160 i160 1 \n495 O-ring  see Note 1  PA11-007 JIS B 2401 P7 1 \n \nNote 1: The part code of the O-ring is the one assigned to NBR-70-1 which is standard material.  \nNote 2: When checking each part (No.30, 33, 50, 480, 491 ) and in case of malfunction's being a little     \nseen, that it is possible to replace, prepare be forehand.

In such circumstances, MAYEKAWA recommends to replace it with a new one.  \nAlso, if it is difficult to stop the compressor operation except for scheduled inspections, MAYEKAWA \nrecommends replacing No.100 in the same way. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.4 Compressor Disassembly Preparation  \n5-10   \n5.4.3 Refrigerant Gas Treatment \n5.4.3.1 Valves Used \nBefore removing the compressor or when performing ai r tightness test or evacua tion, refrigerant gas is \nrecovered and charged.  \nAs the i-series compressor has a built-in check valve, care should be taken.  Work procedures differ between the i125 and i160. \n \n<i125> \nTwo service valves are mounted to the check valve, one at  the top and the other at the bottom. When \nremoving gas from the compressor, the valve at t he bottom is used. The valve on the top side is used \nwhen charging gas into the compressor.   \n \n<i160> \nCheck that the valve attached to the startup pressu re equalizer line is open, and remove or charge \ngas by using the service valve (one location).  \n5.4.3.2 Refrigerant Gas Recovery \nAfter stopping the package unit operation, internal  pressure of the compressor remains high.  \nBefore disassembling the compressor, it is necessary to lower the internal pressure to atmospheric \npressure. The following methods are available. \n \n By using the bypass valve, release the high pressu re gas in the unit to the low pressure side. \n If there is another refrigerating unit connected by bypass piping (or which can be temporarily \ninstalled), operate the other compressor and lower the pressure. \n Operate the refrigerating unit, close the refrig erant fluid supply master valve, and collect the \nliquefied gas in the receiver. \n By using a refrigerant recovery machine, re cover the liquefied refrigerant in the receiver. \n \nFor any of the above methods, prepare a flow sheet describing the operat ions of the work. Verify valve \noperations that are necessary for each method, according to the fl ow sheet and on the actual unit.  \nSpecify operation valves as well as connected devices and tubes on the flow sheet. \nPrepare one flow sheet for the foreman and another one for display at the work area. \nIn addition, prepare a refrigerant collection procedure with the workplace situation considered. Be sure \nthat all the personnel related to the work will read it together for confirmation, before starting the work. \n \n \n Be sure to confirm and make known the work contents and procedures described \nin the work procedure, and inform the estimated risks to the related personnel, \nbefore the work. Neglecting these efforts will increase the industrial accident \noccurrence rate to a level that cannot be ignored. \n After closing (opening) a valve for work, conduct lockout/tagout to prevent it \nfrom being handled accidentally during work. \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.4 Compressor Disassembly Preparation  \n5-11   \n5.4.4 Removing Parts Connected to the Unit \n \n If refrigerant gas or a mixture of refrigerant and oil remains in the compressor, \nrefrigerant gas may blow off when the closed circuit is opened. This may result in \ninjury such as frostbite or loss of vision. Be sure to confirm that there is no \nresidual pressure before opening any pipe connections. \n \n If the compressor is removed when the temperature around the suction flange is \nextremely lower than the ambient temperature, dew condensation may occur \ninside the system. After stopping the refrigerating unit, leave it as it is for some \ntime.  \n \nWhen removing the compressor from the unit frame, disconnect the following parts.  \n(1) Flange motor (and motor wiring if necessary) \n(2) The compressor's suction piping and discharge piping \n(3) Compressor's lubrication piping \n(4) Compressor's economizer piping and aquamizer (liquid injection) piping (5) Electrical wiring for capacity control solenoid valves \n(6) Motor spacer \n(7) Bolts for installing compressor (leg bolts) \n \n \nSince remaining oil may leak out when disconnectin g the oil piping from the compressor, slightly \nloosen the piping and observe the oil flow to decide whether to disconnect the piping right now or \nextract oil first from the oil temperature gauge on the lubrication header. When disconnecting electrical wiring, put ma rkings so that it can be reconnected easily. \nUnless reconnected correctly, the compressor may not start up or the capacity control system may\nnot operate. \n \n5.4.5 Removing and Lifting the Compressor \n \n Do not allow anyone other than qualified personnel to lift and carry the \ncompressor. Entrusting the work to unqualified personnel may result in fall \naccident.  \n Be sure not to assemble/disassemble the compressor while it is being lifted. \nThere is a risk that the compressor's main body or parts may drop on human \nbody. \n \n \n5.4.6 Removing Oil from Compressor \nDisconnection of the capacity control Φ8 piping【538】from the compressor will cause the oil remaining \ninside to be drained by approx. 1 liter (i1 25-series) or by 2 lit ers (i160-series).  \nPrepare a container to receive oil and an empty can for storage before starting the work. \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.5 Disassembly and Inspection  \n5-12  5.5 Disassembly and Inspection \n \n When handling heavy objects, exercise extreme care and use apparatus such as \ncrane as necessary. There is a risk that the compressor's main body or parts may \ndrop on human body. \n \nBe careful with handling of the parts during disass embly and inspection. Since the compressor rotates \nat a very high speed, even the slightest handlin g error could cause a si tuation that requires \nreplacement of the rotor and all other important pa rts. Such errors can also cause problems or \nperformance deterioration after the compressor is reassembled. Be sure to fully understand the \nfollowing before starting the work.  \n \n5.5.1 Mechanical Seal  \nMechanical seals have a precisely machined sliding surface and are made of fragile material. \nHandle them with special care since leakage may occur if damaged. \n5.5.1.1 Disassembly \na) Of the eight hexagon socket head c ap screws securing the seal cover 【51】, remove six and leave \nthe two on the opposing sides. \n \nb) Loosen the remaining two screws al ternately and evenly, a little at a time. After a certain amount of \nloosening, the seal cover of the mechanical seal will be pushed by the repulsion force of the bellows \nand a gap will appear. A gap will not appear if the gasket is stuck. In that case, remove the seal \ncover; push the seal cover by screwing M8 eye bolts into the forcing screw holes. \n \nc) Use a container to catch the oil that will leak from the gap in the seal. \n \nd) Pull out the seal cover, while keeping it para llel with the shaft (rotor shaft). The mating ring is \nattached inside the seal cover by using an O-ring 【103】. Be careful not to let the mating ring 【101】\nand the shaft damaged by contact. \n \ne) Remove the O-ring 【49】 from between the seal cover and seal retainer 【48】. \n \n \nPhoto 001 Removing Seal Cover Photo 002 Seal Cover and Mating Ring \n \nf) After removing the seal cover, wipe clean and insp ect the shaft surface. If there are scratches, use \nfine sandpaper to smooth them over. This is done to prevent damage to the internal O-ring when pulling out the mechanical seal. \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.5 Disassembly and Inspection  \n5-13  g) Loosen the set screws 【111】 of the seal collar 【109】 by turning them approximately three times \n(Photo 003). \nDo not remove the set screws completely, but leave th em so that their ends are below the surface of \nthe seal collar. These screws are located in two places 90 degrees apart from each other. \n \nPhoto 003 Loosening the Seal Collar Set Screws Photo 004 Seal Retainer \n \n \nh) Pull out the seal collar with your fingers. While pu lling out, make sure that the ends of the set screws \ndo not touch the shaft surface.  Axial-direction scratches on the shaft can cause leaks. \n i) Screw two eye bolts (removal tools) into the forcing screw holes. Then pull out the seal retainer \nwhile maintaining a right angle to the rotor shaft. \n j) Remove the mating ring from the seal cover. At  this time, be careful not to damage the mating ring. \n \n5.5.1.2 Inspection \na) Mechanical seal should be replaced if any defect is  found during inspection. Actually, however, it is \nsometimes difficult to find out defects on the sliding surface only through visual inspection. In such circumstances, Mayekawa recommends to replace it with a new one in the same manner as with O-rings or gaskets.  \n   The contact between the sliding surfaces of the mating ring and seal collar must be checked even \nwhen replacing the seal. If there are obvious traces of uneven contact or damage, find out the cause \n(degradation over time, problems such as heating operation, etc.) and take necessary actions. \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.5 Disassembly and Inspection  \n5-14  \n \n \nPhoto 005 \nNo. Part Name \n101 Mating ring \nStationary rings 102 Insert lock pin \n103 O-ring \n109 Seal collar \nRotating rings 111 Seal collar set screw \n112 O-ring \nFigure 5-1 Details of BBSE Mechanical Seal Assembly \n \n \n \n5.5.2 Bearing Cover \n5.5.2.1 Disassembly \na) Remove two threaded alignment pins 【3】 by using a  \ntool (slide hammer).

Apart from \nreceiving the thrust load, the bearing has the important  role of securing the position of the gap between \nthe rotor and the discharge side of the bearing head . This gap (end clearance) is significantly linked \nwith performance.  \n5.5.5.1 Disassembly \nThough part sizes differ between the M rotor side and F rotor side, the same work procedure is applied \nto both.  \na) Remove hexagon head bolts 【45】 holding thrust bearing glands 【43-1】 【43-2】, and remove the \nthrust bearing glands. A spring washer 【46】 is attached to the hexagon head bolt. Be careful not to \nlose the washer. \nAs O-rings 【150-1】 【150-2】 are mounted to the thrust bearing glands used for the i160-series, \nthey are slightly tight.   \nb) Extend the bent claw of lock washers 【40-1】 【40-2】.  \nc) Loosen lock nuts 【39-1】 【39-2】 by using a dedicated lock nut socket. If, at this moment, the rotor \nshaft rotates, attach dedicated rotation stoppers 1 and 2 (refer to sectioon 7.2 in this manual) during \nwork.   d) Remove lock nuts, torsional slip washers 【237-1】 【237-2 】 and thrust washers 【250-1】 【250-2 】.  e) Take out thrust bearings 【38-1】 【38-2】. Since the inner race of the bearing is slide fit on the rotor \nshaft, bend the tip of a wire with diameter of 2 to 3 mm, insert it between the outer ring and the ball \nretainer, and hook it onto the thrust bearing to pull it out.    \nf) Remove thrust bearing outer race spacers 【41-1】 【41-2】 and thrust bearing alignment spacers \n【42-1】 【42-2】 . \n \n             Photo 011 Extending the Claw of Lock Washer       Photo 012 Removing the Thrust Bearing \n \n5.5.5.2 Inspection \na) Replace the thrust bearing with a new one during regular inspection, regardless of whether or not it \nis defective. If there is an extr eme problem, find the cause and review the operating state or periodic \ninspection interval to prevent recurrence of such problem.  \nb) If there is a problem such as extreme deformation in the notch of the lock nut, replace the part with a \nnew one.  c) Be sure to replace lock washers and torsional slip washers with new ones.  \nd) O-rings 【150-1】 【150-2】 attached to the i160-series compressor must be replaced with new ones. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.5 Disassembly and Inspection  \n5-17  \n \n5.5.6 Bearing Head \nThough the case dividing method differs between i125 and i160, \nthe work flow is the same. \n \n5.5.6.1 Disassembly \na) Attach lifting tools, remove all bolts 【2-1】 that hold the part to \nthe main rotor casing, and separate the part from the main \nrotor casing. If bearing head gasket 【12】 is stuck, use a jack \nbolt to remove it.  \nb) Remove bearing head 【11】 while taking care not to let it be \nhit and damaged by the rotor shaft. Also take care not to let \nthe rotor fall off the main rotor casing.  \n5.5.6.2 Inspection \na) If the alignment pin is bent or worn, replace it with a new one.  \nb) The bearing head gasket must be replaced with a new one. \n \n \n5.5.7 Rotors \nRotors 【25】 【26】 are heavy, precisely machined \ncomponents, which are the heart of the compressor. \nCare must be taken not to get them damaged by dropping or in other ways. Using damaged rotors may lead to \ndeterioration in performance or damage to the compressor. \n \n5.5.7.1 Disassembly \na) When using the i125-series, remove snap ring 【29-3】 \nfrom the F rotor. \n \nb) As it is heavy in weight, be careful when handling.  As the i160-series rotor weighs more than 30 kg, \nuse lifting tools such as chain blocks and nylon belts . Pull out about two thirds of the rotor, attach a \nbelt around its outer circumference, and then pull out the remaining part of the rotor.  \nc) After pulling out the rotor, place it on V-bl ocks or the like to prevent damage to the outer \ncircumference.  \nd) Remove slotted set screw 【31】. \n \n5.5.7.2 Inspection \nCheck that the rotor is not extremely worn or \ndamaged. Rotors stay almost free from wear during \nnormal operation. \nIf the rotor is found worn, check the cause and revi ew the operating state to preventrecurrenceof the \nproblem. \nIf the part wears beyond the replacement standa rd shown in Table 5-10, performance will be \ndeteriorated. Replacement of the rotor is recommended. \n  \n  \n \n   \n \nPhoto 013 Attach Lifting Tools \n         t o  B e a r i n g  H e a d  \n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \nPhoto 014  Pulling out the Rotor \nmeasurement point i125 i160 \nRotor's outer diameter (mm) 127.475 163.175Table 5-10 Rotor Replacement Standards  \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04.  \nChapter 5 Maintenance and Inspection  \nScrew Compressor i-series  5.5 Disassembly and Inspection  \n5-18  \n5.5.8 Radial Bearing \nTwo pairs of large and small radial bearings are used.  Put the disassembled parts in order to distinguish \nwhich bearing has been used where. \n5.5.8.1 Disassembly \na) Put the radial bearing with the side containing the bearing for bearing head 【11】 faced upward.  \nb) Remove stop rings 【29-1】 【29-2】, and pull out the outer rings of radial bearings 【27-1】 【27-2】 . \n* For the i125-series, the snap ring is attached to the main rotor casing side.  \nc) Pull out the outer ring of the radial  bearing from the main rotor casing.  d) Remove the inner ring of the radial bearing from  the rotor after inspection. As the inner ring is \nshrink-fitted to the rotor, pull it out by heating it with a tool like a burner.  \n   Beforehand, remove oil such as lubricant sufficiently. Set the rotor with its inner ring (which is to be \npulled out) faced downward and heat the inner ring only. Then the inner ring will come off. \n5.5.8.2 Inspection \nReplace the radial bearing with a new one during regu lar inspection, regardless of whether or not it is \nfound defective. \nHowever, if there is an extreme problem, find the cause and review the operating state or periodic \ninspection interval to prevent recurrence of such problem. \n \n5.5.9 Suction Strainer and Check Valve \nThe structure of the suction strainer and check valve differ between i125 and i160. \n5.5.9.1a  Disassembly (i125)  \na) Remove strainer cover 【5-2】.

Be sure to use a jack bolt for this removal. Be careful not to let the \ncheck valve main body fall at the inside.  h) Remove the check valve main body.  \ni) Remove hexagon nut 【486】 from check valve shaft 【491】. Remove plain washer 【46-2】, seat \nstopper 【488】, valve seat 【489】, valve plate 【490】 and O-ring 【495】. \n5.5.9.2 Inspection \na) If the main body of the check valve does not move  smoothly, the check valve shaft may be worn or \nbent. Replace it with a new one.  \nb) Strainer element, check valve spring and hexagon nut must be replaced if there are problems such \nas extreme deformation or chipping. \n* With i160 series, the inner cylinder of the strain er element may be deformed, but this is normal.  \nc) The gasket, O-ring and valve seat must be replaced with new ones. \n \n \n \n5.5.10 Unloader \n5.5.10.1  Disassembly \na) Attach lifting tools to the motor-side end face of the main  \nrotor casing, and lay down the unloader horizontally.   \nb) Remove Φ8 piping 【538】.   \nc) Of the bolts securing unloader cover 【393】, remove all but \nthe two on the opposing sides. Loosen the remaining two  \nbolts alternately, and remove the unloader cover.  \n   At this moment, the unloader cover is being pushed from \ninside by spring. Remove the bolts carefully.  \nd) Pull out unloader piston 【391】and spring 【392】 (Photo 016). \n5.5.10.2  Inspection \na) Mount an M8 bolt of the maximum allowed length to the unloader piston, insert it in the main rotor \ncasing, and check the operation. If it does not move smoothly, the piston or casing may be worn or \ndamaged, or have burr formed. If removal of the burrs and damages cannot improve the movement, \nreplace the unloader piston with a new one.  \nb) If the spring is extremely worn or deformed, replace it with a new one.  \nc) Unloader cover gasket 【395】 must be replaced with a new one.

There is a risk that the compressor's main body or parts may \ndrop on human body. \n When using a crane, allow only qualified personnel to operate it. Entrusting the \nwork to unqualified personnel may result in fall accident. \n Replace parts with \n  genuine parts. If parts other than genuine parts \nare used, there is a risk of the compressor and equipment being damaged or \nruptured. \n \n \n For compressor disassembly/reassembly, use specified tools that are properly \nfunctioning. Using tools that are worn or damaged or that are unsuitable for the \nwork, can result in injury. \n When using electric tools, check beforehand that there is no problem with \ninsulation resistance. Otherwise, use double insulated tools. \n \n \n When reassembling, ensure that the replaced O-rings are of the correct standard \n(size, material, use for fixed portion or sliding portion, etc.). Incorrect \nreplacement can lead to defects such as oil leakage. \n Some gaskets are asymmetrical. In that case, ensure that the assembly direction \nis correct. If the assembly direction is not correct, problems such as blocking of \noil passages machined in the casing may occur, resulting in serious defects. \n \nStart assembly after disassembly and inspection are finished. \nRecheck the purchased replacement parts before assembly. All the O-rings and gaskets of the parts removed du ring the overhaul work should be replaced by new \nones. Almost all assembly procedures are reverse to th e disassembly procedures. First, clean the work \nbench and tools to be used. Clean the assembly parts with cleaning oil (keros ene, etc.) immediately before assembly. Dry these \nparts by blowing compressed air, and then apply suff icient lubricant over their surface. Prepare \nsufficient amount of clean lubricant for use during reassembly. Also apply oil to both sides of the gasket. \n \n \nTable 5-11 Tightening Torques for Hexagon Socket Head Cap Screws \nUnit M6 M8 M10 M12 M14 M16 \nN·m 10 25 50 90 140 240 \nkgf·cm 100 250 500 900 1400 2400 \nTighten each bolt by referring to the torque shown in the above table. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nChapter 5 Maintenance \nScrew Compressor i-series 5.6 Reassembly \n5-21 \n5.6.1 Unloader \na) In the same way as for disassembly, lay main rotor casing 【1】 on its side (horizontally). \n \nb) Set unloader cover gasket 【395】, unloader piston \n【391】 and spring 【392】 to unloader cover 【393】. \nYou can install the unloader piston and spring first. \n \nc) Insert this into the main rotor casing, and tighten \nthe unloader cover. \n \nd) Screw an M8 bolt of the maximum allowed length \nthrough the Rc1/4 hole of the unloader cover and \nscrew it to the unloader piston. \nCheck that the piston moves properly. \n \ne) Remove the M8 bolt, and install Φ8 piping 【538】. \n \nf) Raise (set vertical) the main rotor casing. \n \n  \n                                                            Photo 017 Installing Φ8 Pipe \n \n5.6.2 Rotor and Inner Ring of Radial Bearing \nMake the rotor sufficiently adjusted.

This is essential to control the end clearance of the rotor discharge \nside. \n Even when assembling the same bearing, dime nsions may become incorrect if flakes \nof paint or dirt are caught between outer race spacers and alignment spacers. \n Regarding the direction of thrust bearing assembly, there may or may not be a \nV-shaped mark for assembly on the outer side of the bearing. Follow the instructions \nbelow for each case of assembling. \n \na) The procedure for assembling this portion is described in Figure 5-3. \nThe important points are explained below. \nIf there is a V-shaped mark for assembly on the outer  side of the thrust bearing, assemble with the \npointed end of the mark on the inner side of the mach ine, as there is a slight directional difference \nthat affects end clearance adjustment. If there is no V-shaped mark, assembly direct ion does not affect end clearance adjustment. \nHowever, to clarify the difference between the i nner side and outer side of the machine, assemble \nthe thrust bearing with the bearing number engravings on the outer side and then put down a V-shaped mark on the machine's inner side by using blue sharpening stone. \n \nb) After assembling the thrust bearing, install thrust washers 【41-1】 【41-2】, lock washers 【40-1】\n【40-2】 and torsional slip washers 【237-1】 【237-2】. \n \nc) Attach dedicated shaft rotation stoppers 1 and 2. Tighten lock nuts 【39-1】 【39-2】 to the specified \ntorque shown in Table 5-13 or to the specified tightening angle shown in Table 5-14 (see \"7.1 Tightening Angles for Lock Nuts\" in this manual for details), to fix the inner ring of the thrust bearing \nto the rotor shaft. Be sure to use a new lock washer. \n \nTable 5-13 Tightening Torques for Lock Nuts \n \n i125 i160 \nM rotor F rotor M rotor F rotor \nTightening \ntorque N·m 116  166 306 400  \nkgf·cm 1160 1660 3060 4000 \n \nTable 5-14 Tightening Angles for Lock Nuts \n \n Model Angle range \nFirst turn of tightening For both M and F rotors (i125 / i160) 30° to 40° \nSecond turn of tightening For both M and F rotors (i125 / i160) 20° to 30° \n \n \n Since the inner ring of the thrust bearing is loose fit to ease assembly work at the \nsite, and is secured by the tightening force of the nut alone, the tightening work is \nvery important! \n If the thrust bearing has been replaced, th e difference between the bearing inner ring \nand outer ring surfaces will be different even when the parts are manufactured within \nstandard values. Therefore, fully tightening the nut from the initial use may lead to a \nnoticeable reduction in the life of bearing, due to a lack of end clearance between the \nrotor and the bearing head discharge end f ace, and also due to indentations on the \ncontact surface formed by ball pressure. To avoid this, check for end clearance while \ntightening. \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nChapter 5 Maintenance \nScrew Compressor i-series 5.6 Reassembly \n5-26 \n \n5.6.6.1 End Clearance Measurement \nAt this moment, measure the end clearance on t he discharge side of the fully assembled rotor. \nIn particular, when the thrust bearing has been replaced, the end clearance must be measured. Even \nwhen the same bearing is used, measure the end clearance for confirmation. \nIf the clearance does not fall within the specifi ed range shown in Table 5-15, adjustment is needed. \n \nTable 5-15 End Clearance \n i125 i160 \nEnd clearance  mm 0.03 to 0.05 0.07 to 0.13 \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nPhoto 025\n Attaching Dial Gauge to            Photo 026  Tightening Thrust Bearing Gland \n                R o t o r  S h a f t  E n d   \n \nThe measurement method and adjustment method are explained below. \n \na) Push the rotor from the suction side to the di scharge side while the thrust bearing inner ring is \nsecured to the rotor shaft, by using a tool (such as the handle edge of a soft hammer).  \n   Alternatively, by using a chamfered part of the lo ck nut, pull out the rotor with the edge of a flat blade \nscrewdriver. \n \nb) When the rotor has been pushed to the discharge si de, prepare to install the thrust bearing gland. \nAttach a dial gauge to the edge of the s haft, and match the needle to 0 (Photo 025). \nThe dial gauge should be attached to the suction side, as shown in Photo 026, in order to make the bearing gland tightening work easier and precise. \n  \nc) Secure bearing glands 【43-1】 【43-2】 by tightening the four bolts 【45】 evenly and gradually to \nthe specified torque as shown in Table 5-15. Tightening each bolt to the specified torque at once will \nlead to uneven tightening. Tighten bolts in turn a nd in several steps. Then, read the dial gauge \nmeasurement. This value is the actual end clearance. \n \nTable 5-14 Tightening Torques for Thrust Bearing Glands \n i125 i160 \nTightening \ntorque N·m 30 40 \nkgf·cm 300 390 \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nChapter 5 Maintenance \nScrew Compressor i-series 5.6 Reassembly \n5-27 \n \n5.6.6.2 End Clearance Adjustment \n When end clearance is smaller than the specified value  \nTo deal with this, insert shim material (thrust adjustment liner) of required thickness (difference in \nthickness from the specified value) between the thrust bearing alignment spacer 【42】 and thrust \nbearing inner race. \n* The thrust adjustment liner is not shown in the development view, but available from us. Place an \n order together with a model name.  \nOr using a highly accurate surface grinding mach ine or asking professional service vendors to \ngrind, grind the surface of thrust bearing outer race spacer 【41】 by the difference from the \nspecified value. After grinding the flat surface,  measure the whole circumference of the thrust \nbearing outer race spacer by using a micromet er, and check that the thickness is even. \n \n When end clearance is larger than the specified value  \nAs the end clearance is excessive, remove shim material (thrust adjustment liner) of a thickness \nequal to the difference between the measured value and the specified value if the shim material is used between thrust bearing alignment spacer and thrust bearing inner race. Or if the shim material is not used between th rust bearing alignment spacer and thrust bearing \ninner race, or even if used but insufficient thickn ess, grind the surface of thrust bearing alignment \nspacer【42】 by the difference between the measured value and the specified value or ask \nprofessional vendors to do so. After grinding the flat surface, measure the whole circumference of the spacer by using a micrometer, and check that  the thickness is even. \n \n Rotor axial runout measurement  \nWhen the end clearance has been adjusted to within the specified  \nrange, place a dial gauge on the seal attachment portion of the M  rotor shaft (FIgure 5-4) . Measure axial runout by turning the rotor  shaft. The tolerance for axial runout is 0.03 mm or less for all models. Runout occurs when the thrust bearing alignment spacer and outer  race spacer are not parallel or when the thrust bearing mark is not  at the correct side. Small particles of dirt trapped between parts  may cause excessive runout. If axial runout is over the tolerance, even if the end clearance is  within the specified range, disassemble and adjust the relative  positions of the thrust bearing outer race spacer, alignment spacer and thrust bearing. This is important because it affect s the life of the mechanical seal  \nand its performance. If axial runout still exceed s the tolerance even when no such assembly \nproblems exist, contact us. The rotor shaft may be bent.   \n5.6.6.3 Tightening after End Clearance Adjustment  \na) Bend the lock washer claw to the notch of the lock nut  \nwhich is tightening the thrust bearing inner ring,to prevent  \nrotation.  \nb) Remove the hexagon head bolts that are tightening \nthrust bearing gland 【43】 one bye one. \nInsert spring washer 【46】 as rotation stopper, and  \ntighten to the specified torque again. \n   In case of i160, use a flat washer 【46-2】 and spring \n   w a s h e r  【 46-1】, and tighten to the specified torque. \n    \n  Photo 027  Bending the Lock Washer Claw Figure 5-4 Dial gauge  \nposition (example i125) \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nChapter 5 Maintenance \nScrew Compressor i-series 5.6 Reassembly \n5-28 \n \n5.6.7 Balance Piston \na) With the notch of balance piston 【30】 aligned with the slotted set screw of M rotor shaft 【31】, \ninstall the balance piston.  \nb) With the notch of t he balance piston sleeve 【33】 aligned with the spring pin, install the balance \npiston sleeve.  \nc) Install snap ring 【32】 and O-ring 【 35】. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n                                         \n \n5.6.8 Bearing Cover \n \na) Screw two stud bolts symmetrically to the flange surf ace of the main rotor casing.

The purpose of this \nchange is to improve oil flow from inside the seal box so that the pressure will not rise too high.   \n   Place a Teflon or other kind of resin block on the oil and tap on the bl ock to push the oil seal into the \nretainer evenly until it bottoms. When it gets fully pushed in, you will know by the change in the \ntapping sound and feel. After assembly, check that the step formed at the boundary between the oil \nseal and the retainer is even. See from the opposite side, and confirm that they are evenly assembled.  \nd) Use two eye bolts (M8) to assemble the seal retainer with the oil seal along the rotor shaft. \nAt this time, ensure that the retainer's oil hole is on the upper side of the rotor shaft, and accurately \nalign the rotation stop spring pin 【20】, which has been screwed to the bearing cover, with the notch \nof the retainer. After assembly, try to turn the re tainer's eye bolts to check that they are secure. \nIf they are properly aligned, the retainer will not rotate. \n \ne) Then, insert the O-ring 【49】 for the seal retainer.   \n Take special care, because users frequently omit to insert this O-ring 【49】.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n      Photo 036\n Assembling Seal Retainer             Photo 037  Inserting O-ring 【49】 \n \n f) Assemble mechanical seal assembly to rotor shaft. Before assembly, apply sufficient lubricant \n(prepared for use during assembly) to the rotor s haft and seal as if intending to wash away dirts. \nThen push the seal ring by hand to check it  for axial movement. Push in the O-ring 【112】, while \ntaking care not to get it damaged by the step on the rotor shaft.   \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nChapter 5 Maintenance \nScrew Compressor i-series 5.6 Reassembly \n5-30 \n \ng) By using two seal collar set screws 【111】, tighten the seal collar against the countersunk holes in \nthe rotor shaft. Tightening the seal collar at ot her places than the countersunk holes can cause \ndamage to the rotor shaft which can lead to leakage.  \nh) Assemble O-ring 【103】 for mating ring and mating ring 【101】 to seal cover 【51】. \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n    Photo 038\n Tightening Seal Collar Set Screws    Photo 039  After Assembly of Mating Ring \n \n \ni) Apply oil to seal cover gasket 【52】, align the gasket oil hole with the bearing cover oil hole, and \naffix gasket to the flange.  \n   * The i-series compressors employ the standard internal oil supply type. With this type, the bearing  \ncover and the seal cover are conn ected by drilled oil supply holes. Oil flows through the notch in \nseal cover to upper side of seal cover, and then goes through the drilled oil supply holes to the  \nsliding surfaces of mechanical seal assembly.  \nj) Install the seal cover with the gasket, so that t he oil removal piping of the seal cover is on the bottom \nside. \nAt this time, assemble it carefully, either at a ri ght angle or by delaying the upper side slightly, while \npaying attention not to cause the mating ring inside the seal cover hit against the rotor shaft. \nThe seal collar and the mating ring sliding surface will come into contact midway through \nattachment. \nAt this moment, check the dimensions between t he seal cover gasket and the bearing cover flange \nsurface by using a taper gauge. This value is called tightening allowance for seal. \nIt is used when checking the sliding face pressure between the rotating ring and fixed ring of the \nseal. If this value is not within the range shown in Table 5-17, measures should be taken, such as \nreplacement of mechanical seal assembly or addition of another gasket. With i-series compressor, the thicknes s of the seal cover gasket is 0.5 mm. \n  \n                                                   Table 5-17\n Tightening Allowance for Seal \n \n \n  \n \nSeal        Bearing cover \nCover \n* The hatched portion represents gasket. \n  \n \n          Photo 040            Figure 5-5 Checking Tightening Allowance \n Checking Tightening Allowance     Model BBSE seal \ni125 2.0 to 3.0 \ni160 2.0 to 3.0 Taper gauge \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nChapter 5 Maintenance \nScrew Compressor i-series 5.6 Reassembly \n5-31 \n \nk) When the seal tightening allowance is proper, push the \nseal cover firmly into the bearing cover. \nSince there is repulsion force of the seal bellows, keep \nit pushed firmly and tighten the two hexagon socket head cap screws (for tightening the seal cover) evenly at \npositions 180 degrees apart. \nWhen the gasket surface get s free of gap, tighten all of \nthe remaining screws.  \nm) When tightening of the seal cover is finished, supply oil \nto the seal cover while rotating the shaft.  n) After supplying oil, be sure to install the plug. \n \n    \n                                                            P h o t o  0 4 1\n Supplying Oil \n \n  \n5.6.10 End Cover \n \na) Screw two stud bolts (i125:M12/i160:M16) symmetrically, and then place end cover gasket 【23】.  \nb) Install end cover 【22】.

In what is described here, there are overlapping explanations in chapter 1 to \nchapter 4 of this manual, but please refer to it as explanation to supplement them.   \n Basic Flow of the Package Unit \nFigure app.-1 is the reference flow of th e package unit using i-series compressor. \nCirculation of the lubricant (refrigerating oil) is  necessary for the compressor for lubrication and \ndischarge temperature adjustment of the sliding su rface parts such as bearings, mechanical seal \nassembly and the rotors. \nGenerally, oil separator, oil cooler, oil filter(s), protection switches or sensors and valves become \nthe basic component. \nThe i-series compressor can use the flange type motor by using an exclusive motor spacer. \nOil pump is not necessary for the i-series compressor for differential pressure oil supply system. \nTherefore it is necessary to secure the lowest oil supply pressure (high and low differential \npressure) to prevent damage by the poor lubrication of bearings and the mechanical seal \nassembly. \nInstall the oil filter(s) less than 15 μm (β12≧75) filtration precision in the oil line to the compressor to \nprevent the entry of foreign matter such as dust. \nThe gas suction side inside of the i-series co mpressor has a suction filter and a check valve. \nThe compressed refrigerant gases separate lubricant with passing the coalescer inside the oil \nseparator. \nIn order to ensure the minimum differential pressure (oil supply pressure - suction pressure) at the \ncompressor start-up, MAYEKAWA recommends that y ou install a pressure regulating valve in the \noil separator outlet piping. \nIn order to ensure the minimum differential pressure (oil supply pressure - suction pressure) at the \ntime of the compressor start-up, MAYEKAWA reco mmends that you install a pressure regulating \nvalve in the oil separator outlet piping. \nBecause regulations of the refrigerating system va ry according to the use area, at the time of \npackaging, make sure that equipment configuration and operation control flow conform to the \nregulations in your area. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nFigure app.-1  \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nScrew Compressor i-series   \nAppendix -2 \n \n Basic Flow of the Oil Cooler \nThe supply of oil to the compressor must be \nin the range of 30 °C to 60 ° C. Therefore, a \ncooler for lubricant cooling is necessary after an oil separator. \nFigure app.-2 is the reference flow of the  \nwater-cooled oil cooler. \nThe heat exchanger can be chosen with shell  \nand tube type, plate-type, shell and plate-type,  \nthe air-cooled type.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                       Figure app.-2 \n \n                                                \nFigure app.-3 is the reference flow of the thermo-siphon oil cooler.  \nShell and tube type or plate-type are \ngeneral.    \n \nEven in the oil cooler of either method,            \ninstall the oil cooler of adequate capacity \nto cover the oil radiation amount of the compressor.  \nAlso, design considering a piping \npressure-loss and a refrigerant liquid \nwater head.              \n                 \n               F i g u r e  a p p . - 3  \n               \n \nFigure app.-4 is the oil cooling system of liquid in jection. In this case, the heat exchanger is not \nrequired. The oil is cooled by letting the liquid injection port of the compressor breathe in refrigerant \nliquid after decompression. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n                              Figure app.- 4 \n \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nScrew Compressor i-series   \nAppendix -3 \n \n Oil Temperature Control \nGenerally, in order to keep the lubricant \ntemperature in the oil separator, install \nthe oil heater at the bottom of the oil separator. \nIn the cold district, the viscosity of \nlubricant at the compressor start-up is decreased; lubricant is hard to flow, so \nthere are cases that package unit \ncannot secure the necessary oil supply pressure. \nWhen you need to secure the oil supply \ntemperature to the compressor, install \nan oil temperature control valve. \nFigure app.-5 is a reference flow in oil \ntemperature control valve use. \nThe mixing -type three-way valve is  \ngeneral. \n                            Figure app.-5 \n \n Economizer \ni-series compressor has a economizer port  for improvement of refrigerating effect. \nFigure app.-6 is a use example of the general econ omizer system with the i-series compressor \npackage unit. \nDX type composed by a expansion valve and a heat exchanger, and flash tank type inhaling from \ncommon flash tank are general. \nInstall a filter with the ability for filtration less than 100 μm in the economizer line 。 \nIn the case of DX type economizer , type of the heat exchanger can choose with shell and tube type, \nplate type, etc. Use it properly by the system of refrigerator. \nI In addition, the economizer port can also be used as a side load gas inlet port, but since the \ndiameter is small compared to general port for side load port, please contact us for the details. \n \n                          DX type                      Flash tank type \n  \nFigure app.-6 \n2200M4JE-HO-iS2-N_2014.04. \nScrew Compressor i-series   \nAppendix -4 \n Oil Separator \nIn addition to the oil heater installation as describe d in the section of the oil temperature control, \nplease also note the following points. \n \n1) Installation of oil level gauge \n  To manage the lubricant level, an oil level gauges that shows both the upper and lower level  \n  limit must be provided. \n2) Installation of protection device from oil level decrease \nIn case of the oil supply by differential pres sure, install a protection device from oil level \ndecrease. Since there is a possibility that alar m for protection from lubricating differential \npressure decrease does not activate even if the amount of lubricant is insufficient.  \n3) Sufficient stiffness \nIf a horizontal type of oil separator with the compressor and motor mounted on top is adopted, the oil separator must be sufficiently rigidly designed. \n \nFigure app.-7 is an example flow with oil separato r. Choose an appropriate oil separation method \n(coalescer / demister / cyclone system) according to the condition of your refrigeration system.  \n \n            \nFigure app.-7 \n  \n Protection Devices \nPackage unit of the compressor, must be protective devices to prevent damage to the components.  \nInstall the necessary protective devices in accordance with applicable law.  \nGenerally, as shown in Figure app.-1, monitoring and control of pressure and temperature of \nrefrigerant, / oil, are required.  \nIn addition, the range of operation, in accordance with applicable law, the installation of safety valve \nis also required.  \nPlease refer also to section 1.4, Chapter 1 and section 2.3.3 Chapter 2 in this manual. \n \nContact Information_2014.04. \n \nContact -1  Contact Information \n \nHow to Order \n  Genuine Parts \nConfirm the target parts by referri ng to 2.4.3 \"Parts Configuration Table\" in Chapter 2 or 5.4.2 \n\"Replacement Parts\" in Chapter 5 of this manual.  \nPlease inform the Model Name and Serial Number, Part Name, Cord No., and required quantity to our \nlocal sales offices or service centers. \nWhen you need more information about the compressor or have questions, apart from the ordering of parts, please contact our sales offices or service centers. \n \n \nSales Offices/Service Centers \n Sales Offices in Japan (as of April 10, 2014) \nDescription Location Phone/Fax \nHead Office 3–14–15 BOTAN KOTO-KU, TOKYO 135-8482 TEL: 03-3642-8181 \nFAX: 03-3643-7094 \nHokkaido \nBranch 2-5-1, 3-JYO NIJYUUYONKEN NISHI-KU,  SAPPORO-CITY, HOKKAIDO 063-0803 TEL: 011-631-2052 \nFAX: 011-631-2053 \nTohoku \nBranch 8-72, ROKUTYONO-MEMINAMI-MACHI,  WAKABAYASHI-KU, SENDAI-CITY, MIYAGI 984-0013 TEL: 022-288-5001 \nFAX: 022-288-5155 \nKanto \nBranch 3–14–15 BOTAN, KOTO-KU, TOKYO 135-8482 TEL: 03-3642-8968 \nFAX: 03-3641-8468 \nChubu \nBranch 2-9-6, MARUNOUCHI, NAKA-KU, NAGOYA CI TY, AICHI 460-0002 TEL: 052-218-3307 \nFAX: 052-218-3308 \nKansai \nBranch 1-4-27, EBIE, FUKUSHIMA-KU, OSAKA CITY, OSAKA 553-0001 TEL: 06-4795-6000 \nFAX: 06-4795-6033 \nChushikoku Branch 2-3-40, TAKAYADAI, HIGASHIHIROSHIMA CITY,  HIROSHIMA 739-2117 TEL: 082-491-1830 \nFAX: 082-491-1838 \nKyushu \nBranch FUKUOKA-FUJILAND-BUILD. 10F, 2-3, NAKASHIMA-MACHI,  NAKASU, HAKATA-KU, FUKUOKA CITY, FUKUOKA 810-0802 TEL: 092-262-0016 \nFAX: 092-262-0115 \n \n Manufacturing Bases in Japan (as of April 10, 2014) \nDescription Location Phone/Fax \nMoriya Plant 2000, TATSUZAWA MORIYA-C ITY, IBARAKI 302-0118 TEL: 0297-48-1361 \nFAX: 0297-48-5269 \nHigashi- \nHiroshima \nPlant 2-3-40, TAKAYADAI, HIGASHIHIROSHIMA CITY,  \nHIROSHIMA 739-2117 TEL: 082-491-1828 \nFAX: 082-491-1838 \n \nContact Information_2014.04. \nSales Offices/Service Centers \nContact -2   \n Global Network (as of April 10, 2014) \n \nDescription Location Telephone and \n  facsimile No. \nNORTH AMERICA   \nMAYEKAWA CANADA INC. \n(VANCOUVER OFFICE)  12180 RIVERSIDE WAY, \nRICHMOND, B.C., V6W 1K5, CANADA TEL: (1) 604-270-1544 \nFAX: (1) 604-270-9870 \nMAYEKAWA CANADA INC.

Installing the Wheels                     Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \nOPERATION\nBEFORE OPERATING YOUR NEW AIR\nCOMPRESSOR please check the following points\ncarefully:\n1 Check that all nuts and bolts are secure.\n2. Make sure oil has been properly added to\ncompressor. (See Installing Oil and Oil Breather\nCap section.)\nInitial Start-Up Procedure\n1. Open the Air Tank Drain Valve to permit air to\nescape, preventing air pressure buildup in the\nair tank.\n2. Run the compressor for a minimum of 20\nminutes in this “no-load” position to lubricate the\npiston and bearings.\n3.Close Air Tank Drain Valve. Your compressor is\nready for use.\nDepending on the CFM draw of the tools being\noperated, your new Air Compressor can be used foroperating paint sprayers, air tools, grease guns,\nairbrushes, caulking guns, abrasive blasters, tire &\nplastic toy inflation, spraying weed killer andinsecticides, etc. Proper adjustment of the Air\nPressure Regulator is necessary for all of these\noperations. Refer to the air pressure specifications\nprovided with the tool you are using.\nGeneral Overview\nTo compress air , the piston moves up and down in\nthe cylinder. On the down stroke air is drawn in\nthrough the valve inlet. The discharge valve remains\nclosed. On the upstroke of the piston air is\ncompressed. The inlet valve closes and air is forcedout through the discharge valve, through the check\nvalve, and into the air tank. W orking air is not\navailable until the compressor has raised the tank\npressure above that required at the air serviceconnection. The air inlet filter openings must be\nkept clear of obstructions, which could reduce air\ndelivery of the compressor.\nInstallation and Location\nLocate the compressor in a clean, dry and well\nventilated area. The compressor should be located12 to 18 inches from walls or any other obstruction\nwhich would interfere with airflow. Compressor\nshould be loacted in a temperature controlled areabetween 32º and 95º fahrenhert. Place the\ncompressor on a firm, level surface. The\ncompressor is designed with heat dissipation finswhich allow for proper cooling. Keep the fins (andall other parts which collect dust or dirt) clean. A\nclean compressor runs cooler and provides longer\nservice. Do not place rags, containers or othermaterial on top of the compressor.Connecting to Power Source\nThis air compressor is designed to operate on a\nproperly grounded 120 volt, 60Hz, single phase,alternating current (ac) power source with a fused\n20 amp time delayed fuse or circuit breaker. It is\nrecommended that a qualified electrician verify theACTUAL VOLTAGE at the receptacle into which the\nunit will be plugged and confirm that the receptacle\nis properly fused and grounded. The use of the\nproper circuit size can eliminate nuisance circuitbreaker tripping while operating your air\ncompressor.\nExtension Cords\nFor optimum Air Compressor performance an\nextension cord should not be used unless\nabsolutely necessary . If necessary, care must be\ntaken in selecting an extension cord appropriate for\nuse with your specific Air Compressor. Select a\nproperly grounded extension cord which will matedirectly with the power source receptacle and the\nAir Compressor power cord without the use of\nadapters. Make certain that the extension cord isproperly wired and in good electrical condition.\nMaximum length of extension cord should be 50\nfeet. Minimum wire size of extension cord should be12 gauge.\nAttaching an Air Hose\nYour Air Compressor is supplied with a 1/4\" Quick\nDisconnect Air Chuck. Once you have correctly\ninstalled the Air Chuck (See Installing the Air Chuck\non p.4) your compressor will be ready to accept air\nhoses equipped with 1/4\" male air couplers.\nNote: Use only air hoses rated for use with 1 15psi\nair pressure or higher.\nTo install an air hose, equipped with a 1/4\" male\ncoupler:\n1. Pull back on Air Chuck outer sleeve to allow\ncoupler to be fully inserted into Air Chuck.\n2.Insert coupler into Air Chuck.\n3. Release outer sleeve of Air Chuck.\n4.Verify that air hose is securely connected to Air\nChuck by pulling lightly on air hose.\n(See Figure 6)\nFigure 6. Attaching an Air Hose\n5                   Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n6Adjusting the Air Pressure\nYour Air Compressor is supplied with an Air\nPressure Regulator. This Regulator adjusts the air\npressure.\nTo increase air pressure, turn Air Regulator\nclockwise.\nTo decrease air pressure, turn Air Regulator\ncounterclockwise.\n(See Figure 7)\nCold W eather Starting\nTemperatures below freezing (32°F) cause the\nmetal parts of your Air Compressor to contract and\nthat makes starting more difficult. To assist the Air\nCompressor in starting in cold weather, follow\nthese tips:1. Try to keep Air Compressor stored in\ntemperatures above 32° fahrenheit.\n2.Open the Air Tank Drain V alve and release all\nair pressure from the Air Tank before attempting\nto start in cold weather. (After air is released\n3.Plug Air Compressor directly into a 120 volt\nelectrical outlet. Do not use an extension cordwhen starting your Air Compressor in cold\nweather.\nMAINTENANCE\nDaily (or before each use)\n1. Check oil level\n2.Drain condensation from the air tank.\n3.Check for any unusual noise or vibration.\n4. Be sure all nuts and bolts are tight.\nWeekly\n1. Clean breather hole on Oil Breather Cap.\nMonthly\n1. Inspect air system for leaks by applying soapy\nwater to all joints. Tighten these joints if leaksare discovered.6 Months (or after 250 hours of operation -\nwhichever comes first)\n1. Change Air Compressor Oil.\nNote: Change oil more often if Air Compressor is\nused near paint spraying operations or in dusty\nenvironments.\nChecking the Air Compressor Oil\n1. Place Air Compressor on level surface. The oil\nlevel should be at the red dot on the Oil Sight\nGlass.\n2. If oil level is low, remove Oil Breather Cap and\nadd enough oil to bring the oil level to the red\ndot on the Oil Sight Glass.\n3. Replace Oil Breather Cap before starting\ncompressor.\nChanging the Air Compressor Oil\nNote: This compressor uses only SAE 5W-30 \nmotor oil.\n1. Remove the Oil Sight Glass by turning counter-\nclockwise with wrench.\nNote: Oil will begin to drain as Oil Sight Glass is\nloosened. Place a funnel and oil pan in placeBEFORE loosening Oil Sight Glass.\n2. Once Oil Sight Glass is removed, tilt Air\nCompressor backwards to allow all of the oil todrain out of the crankcase.\n3. Once oil is drained, replace Oil Sight Glass and\nsecurely tighten in place with a wrench. Becareful not to overtighten the Oil Sight Glass, asthis could damage the rubber seal.\n4.Place Air Compressor on level surface.\n5.Remove the Oil Breather Cap.\n6. Slowly pour the oil into the oil fill hole, until the\noil level rises to the center of the red dot on the\nOil Sight Glass.\n7. Install the Oil Breather Cap into the oil fill hole.\nFirmly hand tighten the Oil Breather Cap by\nturning clockwise.\nAlways inspect the tool before use, and make sure\nit is in good working condition. Make sure all airvents are clear , (use compressed air to clean the\nmachine where possible). Check the power cable tomake sure it is intact and free from cracks, barewires etc. Avoid using solvents when cleaning\nplastic parts, most plastics are susceptible to\ndamage from the various types of commercial\nsolvents.\nFigure 7.

Follow all codes, pipe adequately, understand thestarting and stopping sequence.Check the safety devicesby following the  procedure contained in this manual.\nMaintenance should be done by qualified personnel,\nadequately equipped with proper tools. Follow themaintenance schedules as outlined in the operatorsmanual to ensure problem free operation after start up.Safety instructions in the operators manual are bold-facedfor emphasis. The signal words DANGER, WARNING andCAUTION are used to indicate hazard seriousness levelsas follows:\nDanger is used to indicate the presence of\na hazard which will cause severe personal\ninjury, death, or substantial propertydamage if the warning is ignored.\nWarning is used to indicate the presence of\na hazard which can cause severe personal\ninjury, death, or substantial propertydamage if the warning is ignored.\nCaution is used to indicate the presence of\na hazard which will or can cause minor\npersonal injury or property damage if thewarning is ignored.\nNotice is used to notify people of\ninstallation, operation, or maintenanceinformation which is important but nothazard-related.D!DANGER\n!  WARNING\n!  CAUTION\nNOTICE\nWARNING\nCOMPRESSED AIR AND ELECTRICITY\nARE DANGEROUS.\nBEFORE DOING ANY WORK ON THIS\nUNIT,BE SURE THE ELECTRICAL SUPPLYHAS BEEN CUT OFF–LOCKED & TAGGEDAND THE ENTIRE COMPRESSOR SYSTEMHAS BEEN VENTED OF ALL PRESSURE.\n1. Do not remove the covers, loosen or\nremove any fittings, connections ordevices when this unit is in operation. Hotliquid and air under pressure that arecontained within this unit can causesevere injury or death.\n2. The compressor has  high and\ndangerous voltage in the motor starter andcontrol box. All installations must be inaccordance with recognized electricalcodes. Before working on the electricalsystem, be sure to remove voltage fromthe system by use  of a manual-disconnect-switch. A circuit breaker orfuse safety switch must be provided in theelectrical supply line leading to thecompressor.\nThose responsible for installation of this\nequipment must provide suitable grounds,maintenance clearance and lightningarrestors for all electrical components asstipulated in O.S.H.A. 1910.308 through1910.329.3.Do not operate the compressor at higherdischarge pressure than those specifiedon the Compressor Nameplate or motoroverload will occur. This condition willresult in compressor motor shutdown.\n4. Use only safety solvent for cleaning the\ncompressor and auxiliary equipment.\n5.Install a manual shut off valve (isolation\ntype) in the discharge line.When a safetyvalve is installed between the isolationvalve and the compressor, it must havesufficient capacity to relieve the fullcapacity of the compressor(s).\n6.Whenever pressure is released through\nthe pressure relief valve, it is due toexcessive pressure in the system. Thecause for the excessive pressure shouldbe investigated immediately.\n7. Before doing any mechanical work on\nthe compressor:\na.) Shut the unit down.b.) Electrically isolate the compressor by\nuse of the manual disconnect switch in thepower line to the unit. Lock and tag theswitch so that it cannot be operated.\nc.) Vent pressure from the compressor and\nisolate the unit from any other source ofair.8. There can be adverse effects ifcompressor lubricants are allowed to enterplant air systems.\nAir line separators, properly selected and\ninstalled, will minimize any liquid carry-over.\nThe use of plastic bowls on line filters\nwithout metal guards can be hazardous.From a safety standpoint, metal bowlsshould be used on any pressurizedsystem. Review of your plant air linesystem is recommended.\n9. When a receiver is installed, it is\nrecommended that occupational safetyand health standards as covered in theFederal Register, Volume 36, number 105,part 11, paragraph 1910.169 be adhered toin the installation and maintenance of thisreceiver.\n10. Before starting the compressor, its\nmaintenance instructions should bethoroughly read and understood.\n11. After maintenance functions are\ncompleted, covers and guards must bereplaced.\n0.2 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\nBEFORE PROCEEDING,READ CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING THE\nCOMPRESSOR OR PERFORMING ANY MAINTENANCE\n4WARNINGFailure to adhere to these recommendations can result in mechanical failure, property damage and serious injury or death.\nAll air and water inlet, and air and water discharge pipework to and from the inlet and discharge port connections must take\ninto account vibration, pulsations, temperature, maximum pressure applied, corrosion and chemical resistance.In addition, itshould be noted that lubricated compressors will discharge some oil into the air stream;therefore, compatibility betweendischarge piping, system accessories and software must be assured.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the use of plastic piping, soldered copper fittings and rubber hose as discharge piping is not\nrecommended.In addition, flexible joints and/or flex lines can only be considered for such purposes if their specifications fitthe operating parameters of the system.\nIt is the responsibility of the installer and owner to provide the appropriate service pipework to and from the machine.WARNINGCHECKHIGHAIRTEMPERATURE\nThere is a high discharge air temperature shutdown function built into the Intellisys on each compressor.It is factory pre-set\nat 228°F (109°C).This function should be checked at regular intervals for proper operation, once a month is recommended.The procedure is:\n1. Block off the cooling air discharge.\n2. The compressor discharge temperature will rise at a rapid rate.Shutdown should occur when the discharge\ntemperature reaches the pre-set maximum discharge air temperature setting of the Intellisys.The display shouldindicate “HIGH AIREND DISCH TEMP”and flash “ALARM”.\nThe actual temperature at which shutdown occurs should be recorded for comparison to the Intellisys set point and withsimilar future test results.SAFETYSHUTDOWN\n“Ingersoll-Rand air compressors are not designed, intended, or approved for breathing air.Ingersoll-Rand does not approve\nspecialized equipment for breathing air application and assumes no responsibility or liability for compressors used forbreathing air services.”\n39540174 Rev.05\n50.3 DECALS\nThis section contains representative examples of decals\nwhich will be appearing throughout this manual and areapplied to the compressor unit.If for some reason adecal is defaced, painted over, or parts are replaced, werecommend that you obtain a replacement kit as listed inthe spare parts section of the Parts List Manual FormAPDD 735 for single stage and Form APDD 736 for twostage units.\nWARNING!\nHazardous voltage.Can cause\nsevere injury or death.\nDisconnect power before servicing.\nLockout/Tagout machine.\nWARNING!\nHot surface.Can cause severe injury.\nDo not touch.Allow to cool before\nservicing.\nWARNING!\nHigh pressure air.Can cause severe injury or death.\nRelieve pressure before removing filter\nplugs / caps, fittings or covers.\nCAUTION\nImproper maintenance of\ncoolant filter can causecompressor damage.\nChange coolant filter after first \n150 hours of operation and every 2000 hours thereafter or when coolant is changed.\nWARNING!\nMoving parts.\nCan cause severe injury.\nDo not operate with covers removed.\nService only with machine blocked toprevent turn over.\nFiller Cap.\nUse only\nrecommended coolant.\nRead instruction book\nbefore servicing.\n39543921Lift Here*PORO OPTION\n39584529\n*REMOTE START-\nSTOP OPTION39547708\n*FOOD GRADE\nCOOLANT OPTION39568803\nCAUTION!\nUse of incorrect coolant can causesystem contamination.\nUse only SSR ULTRA COOLANT.\n* FOOD GRADE COOLANT \nOPTION 39568464* FOOD GRADE COOLANT \nOPTION ONLY\n*ITEMS MARKED WITH * ARE OPTIONS THAT\nARE AVAILABLE2 REQUIRED -

This heat must be exhausted\nfrom the room. You should take this into consideration\nwhen you decide where to place the compressor withinyour plant.Consider that the required maintenanceclearance is 3 ft (.9 m) all around the compressor.However 42”(1.06m), or minimum required by latest NECor applicable local codes, must be maintained in front ofcontrol panel.\nAmbient temperatures higher than 115°F (46°C)\nshould be avoided as well as areas of high humidity.\nConsider also the environment surrounding or near\nthe compressor.The area selected for the location ofthe compressor should be free of dust,chemicals,metal filings,paint fumes and overspray.\n2.2 FOUNDATION REQUIREMENTSRefer to the foundation plan for the particular modelcompressor to be installed.See Section 8.0.\nThe compressor can be installed on any level floor that is\ncapable of supporting it.Compressor weights are listedon the foundation plans.\nWhen sound transmission is of particular importance it is\noften helpful to install a sheet of rubber-fabric-matting, orcork under the compressor to reduce the possibility ofresonant sounds being transmitted or amplified throughthe floor.2.3 PIPINGThe use of plastic bowls on line filters without metalguards can be hazardous.Their safety can be affected byeither synthetic lubricants or the additives used in mineraloil.From a safety standpoint, metal bowls should be usedon any pressurized system.Review of your plant air linesystem is recommended.\nThe built-in aftercooler reduces the discharge airtemperature well below the dew point (for most ambientconditions), therefore, considerable water vapor iscondensed.To remove this condensation, eachcompressor with built-in aftercooler is furnished with acombination condensate separator/trap.DUST CHEMICALS\nMETAL\nFILINGSPAINT\nSPRAY\nOVERSPRAY\nDo not use plastic pipe,soldered copper \nfittings or rubber hose for discharge piping.WARNING\nNever elevate the compressor unit \nabove the floor level.This may allow air \nto enter the cabinet under the base.\nPerformance will be affected.NOTICE\n936”\n(.9 m)\n36”(.9 m)42”(1.06m) OR\nCODE MINIMUM\n10\nDISCHARGEPIPINGWITHAFTERCOOLER\nROTARY-RECIP IN PARALLELDo not use the compressor \nto support the discharge pipe.\nCareful review of piping size from the compressor\nconnection point is essential.Length of pipe, size of pipe,number and type of fittings and valves must beconsidered for optimum efficiency of your compressor.\nIt is essential when installing a new compressor to review\nthe total plant air system.This is to ensure a safe andeffective total system.\nLiquid water occurs naturally in air lines as a result of\ncompression.Moisture vapor in ambient air isconcentrated when pressurized and condenses whencooled in downstream air piping.\nMoisture in compressed air is responsible for costly\nproblems in almost every application that relies oncompressed air.Some common problems caused bymoisture are rusting and scaling in pipelines, clogging ofinstruments, sticking of control valves, and freezing ofoutdoor compressed air lines.Any of these could result inpartial or total plant shutdown.\nCompressed air dryers reduce the water vapor con-\ncentration and prevent liquid water formation incompressed air lines.Dryers are a necessary companionto filters, aftercoolers, and automatic drains for improvingthe productivity of compressed air systems.NOTICE2.3 PIPING (Continued)\nA dripleg assembly and isolation valve should bemounted near the compressor discharge.A drain lineshould be connected to the condensate drain in thebase.\nIMPORTANT: The drain line must slope downward from\nthe base to work properly.NOTE:For ease of inspection of the automatic drain trap\noperation, the drain piping should include an open funnel.It is possible that additional condensation can occur if the\ndownstream piping cools the air even further and lowpoints in the piping systems should be provided withdriplegs and traps.\nIMPORTANT: Discharge piping should be at least as\nlarge as the discharge connection at the compressor\nenclosure.All piping and fittings must be suitable for themaximum operating temperature of the unit and, at aminimum, rated for the same pressure as the compressorsump tank.\nMOISTURE CONTENT OF COMPRESSED

ELECTRICALINSTALLATION\nBefore proceeding further,we recommend that you\nreview the safety data in the front of this manual.\nLocate the compressor data plate on the side of the\ncooler box or end of the unit.\nThe data plate lists the rated operating pressure, the\nmaximum discharge pressure and the electric motorcharacteristics and power.\nConfirm that the line voltage and compressor nameplate\nvoltage are the same and that the standard starter boxmeets the intent of NEMA 1 guidelines.\nOpen the starter box door.Confirm that all electrical\nconnections are made and tightened.Confirm that thecontrol transformer is wired correctly for supply voltage.See Figure 2.4-1 on next page for typical controltransformer wiring.Two types of dryers, refrigerated or desiccant, are usedto correct moisture related problems in a compressed airsystem.Refrigerated dryers are normally specified wherecompressed air pressure dew points of 33°F (1°C)  to39°F (4°C) are adequate.Desiccant dryers are requiredwhere pressure dew points must be below 33°F (1°C).\nContact your local Ingersoll-Rand distributor for\nassistance in selecting correct Ingersoll-Rand filtration ordrying products.\nNOTE:Screw type compressors should not be installed\nin air systems with reciprocating compressors without a\nmeans of pulsation isolation, such as a common receivertank.We recommend both types of compressor units bepiped to a common receiver utilizing individual air lines.\nWhen two rotary units are operated in parallel, provide an\nisolation valve and drain trap for each compressor beforethe common receiver.\nROTARY TWOCOMPRESSORSYSTEMPRESSURE\nRELIEF\nVALVE\nPRESSURE\nGAUGE\n54425996 Rev.C (75-160 KW)Compressor Package Data\nCOMPRESSOR

or limited space within amanufacturing facility.When this occurs there are certainitems that should be incorporated into the installation tohelp ensure trouble free operation.These items havebeen listed below plus Figure 2.5-1 has been included toshow a typical outdoor sheltered installation.The unitmust be purchased with the Outdoor Modification Optionto provide NEMA 4 electrics and a cabinet exhaust onthe end of the unit rather than the top to prevent recir-culation of cooling air.\nIThe compressor should be on a concrete paddesigned to drain water away.If the concrete pad issloped, then the compressor must be leveled.In orderto properly pull cooling air through the aftercooler, thebase/skid must be sealed to the concrete pad.\nIThe roof of the shelter should extend a minimum of 4 ft (1.2 m) around all sides of the compressor to pre-vent direct rain and snow from falling on the unit.\nIAir-cooled machines must be arranged under theshelter in a way that prevents air recirculation (i.e.hotexhaust back to the package inlet).\nIIf the installation includes more than one compressor,the hot air exhaust should not be directed towards thefresh air intake of the second unit or an Air Dryer.\nIIf a standard machine is to be installed outside, theambient temperature must never drop below 35°F(1.7°C).\nIIf ambient temperature drops below 35°F (1.7°C) to aslow as –10°F (–23°C) the unit must be supplied withthe Low Ambient Option.Installations below –10°F(–23°C) ambient are not recommended.The LowAmbient Option requires a separate power source tooperate internal heaters.\nIArrange the machine with the Intellisys con-troller/starter enclosure facing away from the sun asradiant heat can affect starter/lntellisys performance.Also direct sunlight and UV rays will degrade themembrane touch panel.This is not a warrantablesituation.\nIPower disconnect switch should be within line of sightand in close proximity to the unit.N.E.C.and localelectrical codes must be followed when installing thepower disconnect switch.ICondensate drains must never be allowed to dump onthe ground.Run to a suitable sump for futurecollection and disposal or separation of lubricant andwater mixture.\nIIncoming power connections must use suitableconnectors for outdoor weather tight service.\nIA minimum of 3 ft (.9 m) clearance must be allowedon all four sides of the unit for service access.Ifpossible, access by a forklift and/or an overhead beamhoist should be kept in mind (for eventual service toairend or motor).\nIIf the area around the installation contains fineairborne dust or lint and fibers etc., then the unitshould be purchased with the High Dust Filter Optionand TEFC motors.\nIIf larger debris, such as leaves or trash, are blowing inthe area, the Inlet Panel Filter Accessory should bepurchased and added to the unit (ship loose item).\nISome type of protection such as a fence or securitysystem, should be provided to prevent unauthorizedaccess.\nFIGURE 2.5-1 TYPICAL OUTDOOR SHELTERED INSTALLATION\n15\n163.0 INTELLISYS\nINTELLISYS CONTROLLERINGERSOLLrAND\nINTELLISYS\n3.0 INTELLISYS\n3.1 INTELLISYS CONTROLS\nEMERGENCY STOP

If any of the \ncables are not labeled,label them with the \nappropriate plug designator,P1-P10.These must be plugged into the correct sockets in the replacement controller.\n3) Remove and save the Option Module if one is \nplugged into P9.This must be installed in the replacement controller.Note that it is keyed to plug into P9 only one way.\n4) Remove the six holding screws from the con-\ntroller on the inside of the starter box door.\n5) Remove the controller through the front of the \ndoor, being careful to save the gasket that is between the controller and the door.\n39Power Supply Removal:\n1) Open the starter box door.2) Remove each plug-in connector, labeled J1 -\nJ4, from the circuit board. If any of the cables \nare not labeled,label them with the appro-\npriate plug designator,J1-J4.These must be plugged into the correct sockets in the replacement power supply.\n3) Remove the four screws holding the power \nsupply to the starter plate, save them for mounting the replacement board, and remove the power supply.\n4.14 COOLANT HOSESThe flexible hoses that carry coolant to and from the oilcooler may become brittle with age and will requirereplacement.Have your local Ingersoll-Rand distributorcheck them every 2 years.\nEnsure the compressor is isolated from the\ncompressed air system by closing the isolation valveand venting pressure from the drip leg.\nEnsure the main power disconnect switch is locked\nopen and tagged.\nREMOVAL\nRemove enclosure panels.\nDrain coolant into a clean container.Cover the container\nto prevent contamination.If the coolant is contaminated,a new charge of coolant m\nustbe used.\nHold fitting securely while removing hose.\nINSTALLATION\nInstall the new hoses and reassemble the package byreversing the disassembly procedure.Start thecompressor and check for leaks.4.15 FLUID AND VIBRATION MONITORING\nIngersoll-Rand recommends incorporating predictive\nmaintenance, specifically the use of coolant and vibrationanalysis, into all Preventative Maintenance programs.Predictive Maintenance is designed to increase systemreliability and prevent costly downtime.Through the useof sophisticated diagnostic tools, including fluid, vibration,and optional air analysis, IRA Certified ServiceTechnicians can identify and correct potential problemsBEFORE they can cause expensive unscheduleddowntime.\nHow does predictive analysis work? By establishing an\ninitial baseline for normal operation, and then regularlymonitoring fluid and vibration conditions, any suddendeviation or significant increase from this baseline can beidentified and investigated to pinpoint the cause.Morequickly diagnosing potential problems can directly savemoney by preventing costly failures and reducing oreliminating downtime.In addition, regular conditionmonitoring also helps to maximize the time betweenexpensive preventative maintenance intervals, such ascomponent rebuilds and coolant changes.\n4.16 COOLANT SAMPLING PROCEDUREBring unit up to operating temperature.Draw sample,\nusing pump kit, from separator tank port.DONOT drawsample from drain port or oil filter.Use new hose onpump for each sample, failure to do this can give falsereadings.\n100%\n50%\nOIL FIL\nTER\n40COOLING FAN MOTOR\nIn a standard compressor, the cooling fan motor is wiredat the factory. It is a three-phase motor, protected by asuitable circuit breaker and overload relay.The fan motoris energized at the same time the compressor drivemotor is energized.The fan motor overload is wired inseries with the compressor drive motor overload.If anoverload occurs in the fan motor circuit, both the fanmotor and compressor drive motor will stop.\nAFTERCOOLER\nThe discharge air aftercooling system consists of a heatexchanger (located at the cooling air entrance of themachine), a condensate separator, and an automaticdrain trap.\nBy cooling the discharge air, much of the water vapor\nnaturally contained in the air is condensed andeliminated from the downstream plant-piping andequipment.\n5.3 COOLANT SYSTEM\nCoolant is forced by pressure from the receiver/separatorsump to the inlet port of the coolant cooler and thebypass port of the thermostatic control valve.\nThe thermostatic control valve controls the quantity of\ncoolant necessary to provide a suitable compressorinjection temperature.When the compressor starts cold,part of the coolant will bypass the cooler.As the systemtemperature rises above the valve setting, the coolant willbe directed to the cooler.During periods of operation inhigher ambient temperatures, all the coolant flow will bedirected through the cooler.\nThe compressor injection minimum temperature is\ncontrolled to preclude the possibility of water vaporcondensing in the receiver.By injecting coolant at asufficiently high temperature, temperature of thedischarge air and lubricant mixture will be kept above thedew point.\nThe controlled temperature coolant passes through a\nfilter to the airend under constant pressure.5.0 SYSTEMS\n5.1 GENERAL SYSTEM INFORMATIONThe SSR compressor is an electric motor driven, singlestage, screw compressor—complete with accessoriespiped, wired and baseplate mounted.It is a totallyself-contained air compressor package.\nA standard compressor is composed of the following:\nIInlet air filtration\nICompressor and motor assembly\nIPressurized coolant system with cooler\nISeparation system\nICapacity control system with stepper motor inlet\nIMotor starting control system\nIInstrumentation\nISafety provisions\nIAftercooler\nIMoisture separator and drain trap.\nOptional accessories can provide for such things as\nautomatic starting and stopping, remote starting orstopping, and sequencer.\nThe motor, airend, separator tank, and piping are\nmounted on independent supports.The supports areisolated from the base by rubber isolation mounts.Flexible hoses are utilized on the separator tank coolantout and air discharge to isolate the motor/airend/tank.\n5.2 AIR COOLED COMPRESSORSDESIGN TEMPERATURES\nThe standard compressor is designed for operation in anambient range of 35°F to 115°F (1.7°C to 46°C).Whenconditions other than the design levels described areencountered, we recommend you contact your nearestIngersoll-Rand representative for additional information.\nThe standard maximum temperature 115°F (46°C) is\napplicable up to an elevation of 3300 ft (1000 m) abovesea level.Above this altitude, significant reductions inambient temperature are required if a standard drivemotor is to be used.\nCOOLANT COOLER\nThe cooler is an integral assembly of core, fan andfan-motor, all mounted in the end section of thecompressor enclosure.The cooling air flows in throughthe left end of the enclosure, through the verticallymounted cooler core, and discharges upward through theright end of the enclosure.\n5.4 COMPRESSED AIR SYSTEM\nThe air system is composed of:\n1) Inlet air filter\n2) Inlet valve/stepper motor 3) Rotors 4) Coolant/air separator5) Minimum pressure/check valve6) Aftercooler7) Moisture separator/drain trap\nAir enters the compressor, passing through the inlet air\nfilter and butterfly inlet valve.\nCompression in the screw-type air compressor is created\nby the meshing of two helical rotors (male and female) onparallel shafts, enclosed in a heavy-duty cast ironhousing, with air inlet and outlet ports located onopposite ends.The grooves of the female rotor meshwith, and are driven by, the male rotor.Tapered rollerbearings at the discharge end prevent axial movement ofthe rotors.\nThe air-coolant mixture discharges from the compressor\nthru a discharge check valve into the separation system.This system, self-contained in the separator tank,removes all but a few PPM of the coolant from thedischarge air.The coolant is returned to the system andthe air passes to the aftercooler.The aftercooling systemconsists of a heat exchanger, a condensate separator,and a drain trap.By cooling the discharge air, much ofthe water vapor naturally contained in the air iscondensed and eliminated from the downstreamplant-piping and equipment.\nDuring unloaded operation, the butterfly inlet valve\ncloses, via stepper motor, and the blowdown solenoidvalve opens, expelling any compressed air back to thecompressor inlet.\n5.5 COOLANT/AIR SEPARATION SYSTEM\nThe coolant/air separation system is composed of aseparator with specially designed internals, a two-stagecoalescing-type separator-element, and provision forreturn of the separated fluid back to the compressor.Internal baffles maintain the circumferential flow ofremaining coolant droplets and air.In an almostcontinuous change of direction of flow, more and moredroplets are removed from the air by inertial action andthen returned to the sump.\nThe air stream, now essentially a very fine mist, is\ndirected to the separator element.\nThe separator element is constructed with two\nconcentric, cylindrical sections of closely packed fibers,each held in steel mesh.It is flange-mounted at theseparator-outlet-cover.\nThe air stream enters the separator element radially\nand the mist coalesces to form droplets.The dropletscollected on the outer first stage fall to the separatorsump.Those collected on the inner second stagecollect near the outlet of the element, and are drawnback to the compressor inlet through a filter-screen andorifice fitting installed in the separator scavenge line.\nThe air stream, now essentially free of coolant, flows\nfrom the separator to the aftercooler, then to thecondensate separator, and on to the plant air system.\n5.6 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM\nThe electrical system of each SSR compressor is builtaround the microprocessor-based Intellisys controller.\nThe standard electrical/electronic components,\nenclosed in a readily accessible enclosure include:\n1) IntelIisys controller\n2) Compressor motor starter, with auxiliary contacts\nand overload relays\n3) Cooling fan motor overload relays and circuit\nbreaker or fuses\n4) Intellisys Power Supply Board5) Control transformer and fuses\nOptions, such as power outage restart can be enabled\nby installing plug-in (option) modules in the Intellisyscontroller.\nOPERATIONThe coolant and air discharging from the compressorflow into the separator through a tangential dischargeoutlet.This outlet directs the mixture along the innercircumference of the separator, allowing the coolantstream to collect and drop to the separator sump.\n41\n5.6 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (Continued)\nSTAR-DELTA TYPE STARTER\nBy use of the Star-Delta type starter, the compressormotor can be started and accelerated using a greatlyreduced “inrush”electric current.The starter is completelyautomatic and controlled by the Intellisys controller.Referto the Electrical Schematic 8.1 in Section 8.0.\n5.7 STEPPER MOTOR INLET CONTROL\nThe inlet valve is opened and closed by a stepper motormounted on the inlet valve.The Intellisys controllerregulates the stepper motor to precisely position the inletvalve based upon the demand of the plant air system(See Section 5.8).\nThe stepper motor is maintenance free.Bearings are\nlubricated at the factory and sealed for life.\nNo adjustment of the stepper motor/inlet valve system is\nrequired.\n5.8 CAPACITY CONTROL\nThe SSR compressor is supplied, as standardequipment, with three operator selectable capacitycontrol systems, each designed for different plant airrequirements:— MOD/ACS (Modulation/Automatic \nControl Selector)\n— On-Off Line— Modulation Only\nThe desired control is selected at the Intellisys control\npanel (See Section 3.0).\nAUTOMATIC UNLOADED START\nThe compressor will always start in the unload mode.When unloaded, the inlet valve is nearly closed, theblowdown solenoid valve is open (tank vented), and thecompressor is operating at minimum power.The Intellisyswill open the inlet valve slightly to maintain the propersump pressure to ensure positive coolant flow andsmooth, quiet operation.When the injected coolanttemperature is less than 120°F (49°C), a separator(sump) pressure of 45-50 psig (3.1 - 3.4 bar) will bemaintained.When the injected coolant temperature isabove 120°F (49°C), a receiver pressure of 24-33 psig(1.7 - 2.3 bar) will be maintained.The minimum pressurecheck valve will prevent any backflow of air from the plantair system during unloaded operation.ON-OFF LINE CONTROLFor those plants which have a widely varying air demand,on-off line control will deliver air at full capacity(compressor maximum efficiency condition) or willoperate at zero capacity (compressor minimum powercondition).The compressor is controlled by the Intellisys,responding to changes in plant air pressure.TheIntellisys/stepper motor opens the inlet valve and closesthe blowdown valve (3SV) whenever plant air pressuredrops below the on-line pressure set point.Thecompressor will then operate to deliver full capacity air tothe plant system.If the plant air system pressure rises tothe off-line set point of the Intellisys, the inlet valve closesand the blowdown solenoid valve opens the separatorvent line, allowing separator pressure to drop.Thecompressor will continue to run with minimum powerdraw.\nMODULATION/ACS CONTROL\nFor those plants which have relatively high, constantair-demand relative to the compressor capacity, therecommended control mode is modulation.\nThe modulation control system retains the features of\non-off line control, but provides for throttling of the inletflow up to the modulation off line air pressure set point.\nThe throttling position of the inlet valve is controlled by\nthe Intellisys, allowing the stepper motor to “trim”the inletvalve position as dictated by the line pressure.\nThe modulating pressure range is 10 psig (.7 bar).\nModulation begins when the line pressure reaches themaximum modulation pressure setting minus 10 psig (.7bar) and continues as/if the line pressure rises.Modulation becomes stable when the compressor outputequals the plant air demand.When the modulation is atthe maximum modulation pressure setting the maximumcapacity reduction will be down to approximately 60percent of the compressor rated capacity.If the airdemand has decreased to a level below the 60 percentmodulated output, the line pressure will increase slightlyto actuate the Intellisys, unloading the compressor andventing the separator.\n42\n5.8 CAPACITY CONTROL (Continued)\nMODULATION/ACS CONTROL (Continued)\nThe automatic control selector (ACS) is designed tocontinuously monitor the plant air demand and selecteither the on-off line, or the modulate control mode -whichever is most desirable at any time during anoperating day.\nIt allows the compressor to operate in its most efficient\nmode without attendance, thereby reducing power coststo a minimum.\nWhen the compressor operates in the on-off line control\nmode, the length of time the compressor remains in the“off line”condition is an indication of the plant airdemand.Intellisys controller is sensing and awaiting asufficient line pressure decrease before signaling a shiftto the on line mode.If the “off line”time period isrelatively short, thereby indicating a high demand for air,it is preferable to shift the control system to upper rangemodulation.\nThe Intellisys does this, and does it automatically if the\ncompressor unloads 3 times within a 3 minute timeperiod.\nIf later, the plant demand decreases, and even under\nmodulate control the line pressure reaches the setting ofthe Intellisys controller and the control shifts to the “offline”mode, the time in this mode will still be monitored.Along “off line”time period indicates a low plant airdemand, indicating the desirability of operating in theon-off line mode.\nThe Intellisys then does this, and does it automatically if\nthe compressor operates unloaded for more than 3minutes.\nMODULATION ONLY\nIf MODULATION ONLY is turned on in the set pointroutine, the unit will shift to Modulation control modeimmediately when the unit is running. The 3 cycles within3 minutes time period required for ACS to change toModulation mode is bypassed.The unit will stay inModulation mode until the UNLOAD  button is pressed orthe Mode of Operation set point is changed.\n435.9 AUTOMATIC START/STOP CONTROLMany plant air systems have widely varying air demandsor large air storage capacity which allows for automaticstandby air capacity control.\nDuring periods of low air demand, if the line pressure\nrises to the upper set point, the Intellisys begins to timeout.If the line pressure remains above the lower set pointfor as long as the set time, the compressor will stop.Atthe same time the display will indicate the compressorhas shut down automatically and will restartautomatically.An automatic restart will occur when theline pressure drops to the lower set point.\nThe upper and lower set points and shutdown delay time\nare set on the Intellisys control panel.There is a 10second delay after shutdown during which thecompressor will not restart even if line air pressure dropsbelow the lower set point.This is to allow the motor tocome to a complete stop and the Intellisys controller tocollect current data of operating condition.If line airpressure is below the lower set point at the end of 10seconds, the unit will start unless the load delay timer isset greater than 10 seconds.\nAuto Restart Delay\nThis is the number of seconds the line pressure mustremain below the online set point before the compressorwill start if it was stopped due to an auto start/stopsituation.This timer will not delay an auto restart if thetime is set to 0.\nAutomatic Start/Stop Operation\nWhen in operation, the compressor must meet twospecific timing intervals before the Intellisys controller willstop the unit in an Automatic Start/Stop situation.\nFor this discussion, the timers will be called timer “A”and\ntimer “B”.\nFIRST\nTimer “A”prevents the compressor from automaticallystarting more than 6 times an hour by requiring the unitto run at least 10 minutes after each automatic start.\nThis 10 minute run period can be loaded, unloaded or a\ncombination of the two and allows dissipation of heatgenerated within the motor windings at start.\n44SECOND\nAfter the compressor has started and reached the off-linesetting and has unloaded, timer “B”requires the unit torun unloaded for a period of time that the operator canadjust between 2 and 60 minutes.\nThe setting of timer “B”is part of the options setpoint\nroutine and the timer cancels any accumulated time if thecompressor reloads before the timer cycle has finished.\nAn important point...This unloaded run time may, or may\nnot, be included in the mandatory 10 minute run timeused to cool the motor windings.\nWhen the compressor has completed the settings of both\ntimer “A”and timer “B”, the Intellisys controller stops thecompressor and displays “STOPPED IN AUTORESTART.”\nPressure sensor 4APT continues to monitor the package\ndischarge pressure and sends information to thecontroller which automatically restarts the compressorwhen the pressure falls to the on-line setting.\nAn advantage to this method of automatic start/stop\ncontrol is allowing the compressor to stop much soonerin certain situations and timer settings, thereby reducingpower costs.Some Examples of Operation\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe operator selects an unloaded run time of 2 minutesin the OPTION routine and starts the compressor.Theunit runs loaded for 8 minutes, unloads and then runsunloaded for two more minutes.\nThe total running time is 10 minutes which satisfies timer\n“A”plus the unit ran two minutes unloaded which alsosatisfies timer “B,”therefore, the unit stops automatically.\nThis example shows how timer “B”can sometimes be\nincluded within the timer “A”interval.Think of the twotimers as running parallel.\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe operator selects an unloaded run time of 3 minutesin the OPTION routine and starts the compressor.Theunit runs loaded for 10 minutes and then unloads.\nAt this point, timer “A”has been satisfied but timer “B”still\nwants the compressor to run unloaded 3 more minutesbefore allowing an automatic stop.\nThe total run time for this example will be 13 minutes.Remember....If the unit reloads before timer “B”finishes\nthe 3 minute setting, the partial time is canceled andtimer “B”must restart the 3 minute cycle when thecompressor unloads again.\n45EXAMPLE 3\nThe operator selects an unloaded run time of 10 minutesin the OPTION routine and starts the compressor.Theunit runs loaded 12 minutes and then unloads.\nAfter 12 minutes of running, the 10 minute mandatory\nrun-time for timer “A”has been met but the compressormust continue to run unloaded an additional 10 minutesto satisfy timer “B”.\nAfter 10 minutes of unloaded run time, the compressor is\nstopped automatically and the total run time was 22minutes.\n5.10 REMOTE START/STOP\nThe remote start/stop option allows the operator tocontrol the compressor from a remote mounted start/stopstation.\nTwo different switches can be wired to the controller for\nremote start/stop.(Refer to Electrical Schematic 8.1 forwiring locations).The switches are customer suppliedand must be of momentary type.The stop switchcontacts are normally closed and the start switchcontacts are normally open.When starting the compressor from the remote location,the Start button must be held depressed for\napproximately 2 seconds to activate the remote start\nfunction and then released within a maximum of 7\nseconds or a Remote Start Failure alarm will occur.\nWARNING!\nThis machine is remote\nstart and stop equipped.\nMay start or stop at\nanytime.\nCan cause severe injury or\ndeath.Disconnect power beforeservicing.\nLock and tag out.See Operators / Instruction\nManual.\n466.0

compressor and must maintain anuninterrupted supply of compressed air, the PowerOutage Restart Option allows an Intellisyscompressor torestart automatically 10-120 seconds (adjustable) afterincoming power is restored.\nThe Power Outage Restart Option is turned on by\nplugging in the required option module and enabling itthru the OPTION’S set point routine.The restart timedelay, which is adjustable from 10-600 seconds, can alsobe adjusted while in the option’s set routine on theIntellisys controller.Any time power is restored to thecompressor after a power interruption, a horn located onthe side of the starter box will sound during the restarttime delay (10-600 seconds), after which the compressorwill automatically start.After starting, the compressor willreturn to the mode of operation that the compressor wasin prior to the power interruption.\nThis option may be factory installed or a field installation\nkit is available.\n7.2 SEQUENCER\nThe sequencer option is turned on by enabling it throughthe OPTIONS set point routine.Enabling thisoption will allow the compressor to be controlled by anexternal device, such as an ISC or sequencer, usingthe communications port (P7) on the Intellisys.\n7.3 LOW AMBIENT\nThe lowambient option is turned on by enabling it throughthe OPTIONS set point routine.Also temperature sensor,3CTT, is added to the compressor and connected at P6-7& 8 on the Intellisys.The options set point, minimumcooler out temperature, is set to the minimum temperatureat which the unit can load.When this option is enabled,the compressor, after being started, will not load until theIntellisys reads a temperature from 3CTT at or higherthan the value of the minimum cooler out temperature setpoint.If this option is enabled without installing 3CTT,\na SENSOR FAILURE 3CTT alarm will occur.\n7.4 SEPARATOR DELTA-P SOLENOID\nThe separator delta-p solenoid option is turned on byenabling it through the OPTIONS set point routine.When this option is enabled, the Intellisys will measurethe pressure drop across the separator element byfirst reading the wet side sump pressure.Next theIntellisys will momentarily energize solenoid that willswitch the dry side sump pressure to the sump pressuresensor (3APT).The Intellisys will then read the dryside sump pressure and subtract it from the wet sidesump pressure to measure the pressure drop across theseparator element. Do not enable this option if the\nseparator delta-p solenoid is not installed.This willresult in an incorrect measurement of the pressuredrop across the separator element.\n7.5 SEPARATOR   DELTA-P SENSOR\nThe separator delta-p sensor option is turned on byenabling it through the OPTIONS set point routine.When this option is enabled, the Intellisys will measurethe pressure drop across the separator element bysubtracting the dry side sump pressure (6APT) from thewet side sump pressure (3APT). Do not enable this\noption if the separator delta-p sensor is not installed.This will result in an incorrect measurement of thepressure drop across the separator element and a6APT sensor failure warning.\n7.6 HIGH DUST FILTER\nThe high dust filter option is turned on by enabling itthrough the OPTIONS set point routine.If this optionis enabled, the Intellisys;will change its measurement ofthe inlet filter. Do not enable this option unless a high\ndust filter is installed.\n7.7 LEAD/LAG CYCLE LENGTH\nThe lead/lag cycle length option allows the Intellisys toautomatically switch the online and offline pressuresettingsto the lead or lag values after a programmednumber of hours.This option is enabled by selecting anumber of hours greater than 0 in the OPTIONS set pointroutine.\n7.8 SCHEDULEDSTART/STOP\nThe scheduled start/stop option allows the customer toautomatically start and stop the compressor once eachday, based on the real time clock.This is an installedoption and is enabled by selecting a scheduled start andscheduled stop time.Setting the scheduled start andscheduled stop times to the same value will disable thisoption.\n7.9 REMOTE LOAD/UNLOAD\nThe remote load/unload option gives the operator theability to control the loading and unloading of thecompressor.This option is enabled when two switches are wired to the Intellisys to perform this function.The firstswitch is the master/local input (P3, 25 & 26) and the second switch is the load/unload input (P3,27 & 28).If the master/local switch is closed, the Intellisys will read the load/unload switch for loadingand unloading the compressor.If the load/unload switch is closed, the Intellisys will load the compressor.If the load/unload switch is open, the Intellisys will unload the compressor.If the master/local switch isopen, the Intellisys will ignore the load/unload switch and operate the compressor normally.\n7.10 MODBUS\nThe Modbus option uses the Modbus protocol andmodbus address set points in the OPTIONS menu.Thisis used by the Ingersoll-Rand service organization.\n7.11 INTEGRAL SEQUENCING\nIntegral sequencing allows one compressor, the lead, tosequence up to 3 other compressors.The compressorsare daisy chained together using port P8 on the Intellisys.Each compressor has a unique address and the leadcompressor will sequence the other units in numericalorder based on that address.\nThe lead compressor will be the first to load and the last\nto unload.It is also the only compressor that canmodulate.If the lead compressor’s mode of operation isMod/ACS or Modulation Only, it will modulate when it isloaded.Once loaded, if pressure falls to its online setpoint, the lead compressor will transmit a load commandto the next compressor in sequence.The lead compressorwill then wait for a period of time for the line pressure torise.This time period is determined by the load delay timeset point.At the end of this time period, if line pressure isnot rising, the lead compressor will transmit a loadcommand to the next compressor in sequence.This willbe repeated until the line pressure starts to rise.When line pressure rises to the lead compressor’s offlineset point, it will transmit an unload command to the lastloaded compressor in the sequence.The lead compressorwill do this every 10 seconds until the line pressure startsto fall.\nAfter a certain amount of time or at a certain time, the\nlead compressor can change the sequence by transferringthe lead to the next compressor in the sequence.If the setpoint, Lead Change - Hours, is set to a value greater than0, the unit will operate as the lead compressor for thatnumber of hours before transferring the lead.If LeadChange - Hours is set to 0, the set points Lead Change -Day and Lead Change - Time will be used to determinewhen the lead will be transferred.The Lead Change - Dayset point will contain the day of the week the lead will betransferred.The time of the day will be contained in theLead Change - Time set point.The lead will be transferredwhen the real time clock matches these 2 set points.\nTo connect the compressors for integral sequencing put\nthe 4 position connector into port P8.One connector, I-Rpart number 39186101, will be needed for eachcompressor.The total length of cable for an integralsequencing system is not to exceed 1000 feet.For thecable, use I-R part number 39204508 or equivalent.Thisis a 4 wire, twisted pair cable.Use one pair for pins 1 and2 and the other pair for pins 3 and 4.The connection onport P8 is a one to one connection.The wire on pin 1 onthe first compressor will connect to pin 1 on the secondcompressor and so on.This is true for all 4 wires.\n49\n50\n54418074\nREV B8.0 REFERENCEDRAWINGS\n8.1 ELECTRICAL SCHEMATIC\nSTAR DELTA\n51\n\n5254622865\nREV B\n8.2 FOUNDATIONPLAN\n125-150 HP/90-110KW AIRCOOLEDSINGLE STAGE(CONTINUED)\n53\n54622865\nREV B8.2 FOUNDATIONPLAN\n125-150 HP/90-110 KW AIRCOOLED\nSINGLE STAGE\n8.3 FOUNDATION PLAN\n200 HP/132-160 KW AIRCOOLEDSINGLE STAGE(CONTINUED)\n54622931\nREV B\n54\n8.3 FOUNDATION PLAN\n200 HP/132-160 KW AIRCOOLED\nSINGLE STAGE 54622931\nREV B\n55\n56\n8.4 FOUNDATION PLAN\n125-150 HP/90-110 KW WATERCOOLEDSINGLE STAGE(CONTINUED)\n39925300\nREV C\n578.4 FOUNDATION PLAN\n125-150 HP/90-110 KW WATERCOOLED\nSINGLE STAGE39925300\nREV C\n\n58\n8.5 FOUNDATION PLAN\n200 HP/132-160 KW WATERCOOLEDSINGLE STAGE(CONTINUED)\n39926191\nREV C\n598.5 FOUNDATION PLAN\n200 HP/132-160 KW WATERCOOLED\nSINGLE STAGE 39926191\nREV C\n\n60\n8.6 FOUNDATION PLAN -

(9.30 + Total Dissolved Solids chart value +\nTemperature chart value ) + Hardness chart valve +Alkalinity chart value)\nThe Ll is zero when the water is in chemical balance.If\nthe Ll is greater than zero, there is a tendency to formscale.If the Ll is less than zero, the water tends to becorrosive.\nDissolved oxygen may be controlled in closed cooling\ntowers.Several types of treatments are commerciallyavailable to remove dissolved oxygen.For open coolingtowers, dissolved oxygen is not an easily controlledparameter.Also, a filtration system is recommended forthe water going into the air compressor when using anopen cooling tower.\nIt should be noted that Ingersoll-Rand’s guidelines and\nrecommendations should be used in evaluating the watersystems and the problems that may occur in the normaloperation of our air compressors.If water problemspersist or are not covered above, you should consult aprofessional.\n87LANGELIER INDEX CHART VALUES\nUNITS\n0123456789\n0 0.00 0.30 0.48 0.60 0.70 0.78 0.85 0.90 0.93\n101.00 1.04 1.08 1.11 1.15 1.18 1.20 1.23 1.26 1.29\n201.30 1.32 1.34 1.36 1.38 1.40 1.42 1.43 1.45 1.46\n301.48 1.49 1.51 1.52 1.53 1.54 1.56 1.67 1.58 1.59\n401.60 1.61 1.62 1.63 1.64 1.65 1.66 1.67 1.68 1.69\n501.70 1.71 1.72 1.72 1.73 1.74 1.75 1.76 1.76 1.77\n601.78 1.79 1.79 1.80 1.81 1.81 1.82 1.83 1.83 1.84\n701.85 1.85 1.86 1.86 1.87 1.88 1.88 1.89 1.89 1.90\n801.90 1.91 1.91 1.92 1.92 1.93 1.93 1.94 1.94 1.95\n901.95 1.96 1.96 1.97 1.97 1.98 1.98 1.99 1.99 2.00\n1002.00 2.00 2.01 2.01 2.02 2.02 2.03 2.03 2.03 2.04\n1102.04 2.05 2.05 2.05 2.06 2.06 2.06 2.07 2.07 2.08\n1202.08 2.08 2.09 2.09 2.09 2.10 2.10 2.10 2.11 2 11\n1302.11 2.12 2.12 2.12 2.13 2.13 2.13 2.14 2.14 2.14\n1402.15 2.15 2.15 2.16 2.16 2.16 2.16 2.17 2.17 2.17\n1502.18 2.18 2.18 2.18 2.19 2.19 2.19 2.20 2.20 2.20\n1602.20 2.21 2.21 2.21 2.21 2.22 2.22 2.23 2.23 2.23\n1702.23 2.23 2.23 2.24 2.24 2.24 2.24 2.25 2.25 2.25\n1802.26 2.26 2.26 2.26 2.26 2.27 2.27 2.27 2.27 2.28\n1902.28 2.28 2.28 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.30 2.30\n2002.30 2.30 2.30 2.31 2.31 2.31 2.31 2.32 2.32 2.32\nTENS\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0\n200 2.32 2.34 2.36 2.38 2.40 2.42 2.43 2.43 2.46\n3002.48 2.49 2.51 2.52 2.53 2.54 2.56 2.57 2.58 2.59\n4002.60 2.61 2.62 2.63 2.64 2.65 2.66 2.67 2.68 2.69\n5002.70 2.71 2.72 2.72 2.73 2.74 2.75 2.76 2.76 2.77\n6002.78 2.79 2.79 2.80 2.81 2.81 2.82 2.83 2.83 2.84\n7002.85 2.85 2.86 2.86 2.87 2.88 2.88 2.89 2.89 2.90\n8002.90 2.91 2.91 2.92 2.92 2.93 2.93 2.94 2.94 2.95\n9002.95 2.96 2.96 2.97 2.97 2.98 2.98 2.99 2.99 3.00UNITS\n02468\n30 2.60 2.67 2.54 2.81\n40 2.48 2.45 2.43 2.40 2.37\n50 2.34 2.31 2.28 2.25 2.22\n60 2.20 2.17 2.14 2.11 2.09\n70 2.06 2.04 2.03 2.00 1.97\n80 1.95 1.92 1.90 1.88 1.86\n90 1.84 1.82 1.80 1.78 1.76\n100 1.74 1.72 1.71 1.09 1.67\n110 1.05 1.64 1.62 1.60 1.58\n120 1.67 1.63 1.53 1.51 1.50\n130 1.48 1.46 1.44 1.43 1.41\n140 1.40 1.38 1.37 1.35 1.34\n150 1.32 1.31 1.29 1.28 1.27\n160 1.26 1.24 1.23 1.22 1.21\n170 1.19 1.18 1.17 1.10TENSTENS HUNDREDSAlkalinity (ppm)Temperature ( °F)\n50 .07\n75 .08\n100 .10\n150 .11\n200 .13300 .14\n400 .16\n600 .18800 .19\n1000 .20TOTALSOLIDS(PPM)Total dissolved solids (ppm)\nUNITS\n01234  56789\n0 0.08 0.20 0.30 0.38 0.43 0.51 0.56\n100.60 0.64 0.68 0.72 0.73 0.78 0.81 0.83 0.86 0.88\n200.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98 1.00 1.02 1.03 1.05 1.06\n301.08 1.09 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.15 1.16 1.17 1.18 1.19\n401.20 1.21 1.23 1.24 1.25 1.26 1.26 1.27 1.28 1.29\n501.30 1.31 1.32 1.33 1.34 1.34 1.35 1.36 1.37 1.37\n601.38 1.39 1.39 1.40 1.41 1.42 1.42 1.43 1.43 1.44\n701.45 1.45 1.46 1.47 1.47 1.48 1.48 1.49 1.49 1.50\n801.51 1.51 1.52 1.52 1.53 1.53 1.54 1.54 1.55 1.55\n901.56 1.56 1.57 1.57 1.58 1.58 1.58 1.59 1.59 1.60\n1001.60 1.61 1.61 1.61 1.62 1.62 1.63 1.63 1.64 1.64\n1101.64 1.65 1.65 1.66 1.66 1.66 1.67 1.67 1.67 1.68\n1201.68 1.68 1.69 1.69 1.70 1.70 1.70 1.71 1.71 1.71\n1301.72 1.72 1.72 1.73 1.73 1.73 1.74 1.74 1.74 1.75\n1401.75 1.75 1.75 1.76 1.76 1.76 1.77 1.77 1.77 1.78\n1501.78 1.78 1.78 1.79 1.79 1.79 1.80 1.80 1.80 1.80\n1601.81 1.81 1.81 1.81 1.82 1.82 1.82 1.82 1.83 1.83\n1701.83 1.84 1.84 1.84 1.84 1.85 1.85 1.85 1.85 1.85\n1801.86 1.86 1.86 1.86 1.87 1.87 1.87 1.87 1.88 1.88\n1901.88 1.88 1.89 1.89 1.89 1.89 1.89 1.90 1.90 1.90\n2001.90 1.91 1.91 1.91 1.91 1.91 1.92 1.92 1.92 1.92\nTENS\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0\n200 1.92 1.94 1.96 1.98 2.00 2.02 2.03 2.03 2.06\n3002.08 2.09 2.11 2.12 2.13 2.13 2.16 2.17 2.18 2.19\n4002.20 2.21 2.23 2.24 2.23 2.26 2.26 2.27 2.28 2.29\n5002.30 2.31 2.32 2.33 2.34 2.34 2.35 2.36 2.37 2.37\n6002.38 2.39 2.39 2.40 2.41 2.42 2.42 2.43 2.43 2.44\n7002.45 2.45 2.46 2.47 2.47 2.48 2.48 2.49 2.49 2.50\n8002.51 2.51 2.52 2.52 2.53 2.53 2.54 2.54 2.55 2.55\n9002.56 2.56 2.57 2.57 2.58 2.58 2.58 2.59 2.60 2.60TENS HUNDREDSHardness (ppm)\n88DATE RUN TIME WORK DONE QTY.

While there are standard safety rules, each situation has its \nown peculiarities that cannot always be covered by rules. Through experience and common \nsense, you are in the best position to ensure your safety. Lack of attention to safety can result in \naccidents, personal injury, reduction of efficiency and worst of all, loss of life. Watch for safety hazards. Correct them promptly. Use the following safety precautions as a general guide to safe \noperation:  \nWARNING  \nAll units are shipped with a detailed Operators and Parts Manual.  This Manual contains vital \ninformation for the safe use and effective operation of this unit.  Carefully read the Operators \nManual before starting the unit.  Failure to adhere to the instructions could result in SERIOUS \nBODILY INJURY or PROPERTY DAMAGE. \n Make sure all protective covers and guards are in place, and that the canopy / doors are \nclosed during operation. \n Be very cautious in using this machine in flammable gas risk areas.  Use in these areas may \nrequire additional safety equipment such as gas detectors, exhaust spark arrestors and shut-\noff valves, depending on local regulations of the level of risk involved. \n Relieve pressure from the entire system before attempting to service the compressor or \nremoving any compressor parts. \n Do not attempt to service any part while machine is operating. \n Ensure adequate ventilation when releasing discharge air into a confined space. \nWARNING  \nCheck the compressor sump oil level only when the compressor is not operating and system \nis completely relieved of pressure.  Open service valve to ensure relief of system air pressure \nwhen performing maintenance on compressor air/oil system. \nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS WARNING  MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND \nSERIOUS BODILY HARM. \n Do not operate the compressor at pressure or speed in excess of its rating as indicated in \n“Compressor Specifications”. \n Periodically check all safety devices for proper operation. \n Do not play with compressed air.

Components include a housing (stator), two screws (rotors), bearings, and bearing supports.  Power from the hydraulic motor is transferred to the male rotor through a belt and pulley configuration.  The female rotor is driven by the male rotor.  There are four lobes on the male rotor and five roots on the female \nrotor. \nPRINCIPLES OF OPERATION \nIn operation, two helical grooved rotors mesh to compress air.  Inlet air is trapped as the male lobes roll down the female grooves, pushing trapped air along, compressing it until it reaches the \ndischarge port in the end of the stator and delivers smooth-flowing, pulse-free air to the receiver. \nDuring the compression cycle, oil is injected into the compressor.  The oil lubricates the rotating \nparts and bearings; serves as a cooling agent for the compressed air; and seals the running clearances. \nLUBRICATION SYSTEM \nOil from the compressor oil sump, at compressor discharge pressure, is directed through the oil filter, cooling system, and to the side of the compressor stator, where it is injected into the compressor.  At the same time oil is directed internally to the bearings and shaft seal of the \ncompressor.  The oil-laden air is then discharged back into the sump. \nOIL SUMP \nCompressed, oil-laden air enters the sump from the compressor.  As the oil-laden air enters the sump, most of the oil is separated from the air as it passes through a series of baffles and \ndiffusion plates.  The oil accumulates at the bottom of the sump for recirculation.  However, some small droplets of oil remain suspended in the air and are passed on to the coalescer. \nPRESSURE RELIEF VALVE \nThe pressure relief valve is set at 210 psi .  It is located at the top of the air/oil sump.  This valve \nacts as a backup to protect the system from excessive pressure that might result from a malfunction. \nAIR/OIL COALESCER \nThe coalescer is self-contained within the air end assembly.  When air is demanded at the service line, it passes through the coalescer whic h efficiently provides the final stage of oil \nseparation. Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Operation 31 \n \nMINIMUM PRESSURE VALVE \nThe minimum pressure valve is located at the outlet of the coalescer head and serves to \nmaintain a minimum discharge pressure of 85 psig in operation, which is required to assure adequate compressor lubrication pressure. \nOIL FILTER \nThe compressor oil filter is the full-flow replaceable element type. \nCOMPRESSOR COOLING SYSTEM \nThe compressor cooling system consists of a remote mounted oil/air cooler with an electric fan.  The fan is activated through a temperature switch (180°) and latching relay, so it will not turn off until the compressor is disengaged and the system pressure is fully relieved, or when the engine is turned off.  The thermal valve will divert oil to the oil cooler at 160°F. \nELECTRICAL AND SAFETY CIRCUIT SYSTEM \nThe unit is supplied with an hourmeter, wire harness and a high temperature shutdown switch.  Compressor shutdown occurs in the event of high compressor temperature (> 240°). \nAUTOMATIC BLOW DOWN VALVE \nThere is one blow down valve in the compressor system.  It is located inside the compressor. \nThe valve will automatically bleed the sump to atmospheric pressure when the compressor is disengaged.  The blow down time interval is typically less than 45 seconds. \nCONTROL SYSTEM \nThe prime component of the compressor control system is the compressor inlet valve.  The control system is designed to match air supply to air demand and to prevent excessive discharge pressure when compressor is at idle.  Control of air delivery is accomplished by the \ninlet valve regulation and modulation as directed by the discharge pressure regulator. \nPRESSURE REGULATOR VALVE \nThis valve, located inside the compressor, is used to set the desired discharge pressure within \nthe operating pressure range.  Turning the regulator screw clockwise increases the working \npressure; a counterclockwise movement of the screw reduces the working pressure.  This \nsystem has a maximum operating pressure of 150 psi.  This is factory set and should not be changed without consulting the factory. \n Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n 32 IMT CAS2545 Air Compressor Manual Part No. 99904145 \n \nNOTE  \nThe operating pressure range for most air tool s is between 90 and 125 psi.  Operating above \nthe tools' recommended pressure will decrease the life of the tool.  Higher operating pressure \ncan also over torque nut and bolts fatiguing the fastener and mating parts.  Strictly adhere to \ntool operating pressures and torque standards set forth by the tool manufacturer and the \nspecifications of the equipment that work is being performed on. \nINLET VALVE \nThe compressor inlet valve is a piston operated disc valve that regulates the inlet opening to \ncontrol capacity and serves as a check valve at shutdown. \nAIR AFTERCOOLER \nThe air after-cooler is a second chamber of the oil cooler.  Air leaving the compressor enters the after-cooler. Temperature of the air is r educed to approximately 10-15°F above ambient \ntemperature.  Condensation is directed to the air tank, where it is collected.   \nCONTROL SYSTEM OPERATION \nThe following discussion explains the operation of the control system from a condition of “no load” to a condition of “full capacity” at working pressure.  For the working pressure range of \nyour machine, refer to applicable data in “Specifications”. \nThe pressure regulator, mounted near the fan/cooler assembly, operates as follows: \n1 As the demand for air decreases, the receiver pressure rises.  When this pressure exceeds \nthe set point of the pressure regulator, the regulator opens sending a secondary pressure signal to the inlet valve.  The poppet valve moves towards the valve inlet against the force of \nthe modulating spring inside the valve.  This regulates the opening area of the inlet valve. \n2 If the air demand goes to zero, (service valve closed or air dead headed at tool) the inlet \nvalve will close completely. \n3 As the demand for air increases, the secondary pressure signal to the inlet valve is removed \nand the inlet valve poppet modulates to full open. \n Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Operation 33 \n \nCompressor Operation Test \nEach compressor is bench tested under load at the factory to ensure proper break-in and \noperation.  While it is not necessary to follow any break-in procedures, complete the following checks before putting the unit into service and periodically during use. \n1 Before start-up \na) Check the compressor oil level.  If oil is required, use only IMT synthetic compressor oil.  \nAlways check compressor oil level with the truck cold and the compressor on level ground. \nb) Check the air intake filter indicator (visible at the front of the compressor) for cleanliness \nand obstructions.  A dirty or obstructed filter may cause reduced air output. The indicator \nwill be in the red zone when the filter needs attention. \nc) Avoid operating the compressor package when the side-to-side or front-to-rear tilt is \ngreater than 20°. \nCAUTION  \nPrior to compressor start-up, make sure the cover, guards, and access plugs are in place \nand secured. \n2 With the compressor engaged: \na) Adjust engine speed to ensure that compressor speed does not exceed 8500 rpm (max.) \nunder load.  Crack open air discharge valve until air pressure drops to 125 psi and \nmaintains this pressure.  Doing so simulates a maximum load condition. \nb) If engine speed increase is required, readjust air discharge valve to 125 psi after speed \nhas been increased.  Repeat until appropriate compressor rpm (NOT engine rpm) is achieved.   \nc) Check the compressor rpm using a phototach on the compressor input pulley, located \nthrough the canopy cover. \n \nCompressor Start-Up & Shut-Down \nCompressor Start-Up  \na Make sure all guards, covers, and access plugs are in place and secured. \nb Start the vehicle engine. \nc Engage the PTO per the manufacturer's instructions.   \nd Engage the compressor by turning on the power.  The power switch location varies \ndepending on the installation.  If the compressor is mounted on an IMT service truck with a crane, the power switch is located on the crane remote.  Otherwise, the power switch \nmay be located on the truck or as a custom wiring application.

The correct rotation direct ion is counterclockwise, as shown on the \ncompressor.  Incorrect rotation for more than two seconds may result in compressor damage. \nWARNING  \nThis compressor produces loud noise.  Extended exposure to loud noise can cause hearing \nloss.  Wear hearing protection when operating. \nUse the relay module, visible through the compressor front panel grill, to determine if the \ncompressor is operating normally.  The enable  and power indicator lights will light.  When the \ncompressor oil temperature reaches 180° F, the fan indicator light will turn on, indicating that the \nfan is running.  Once the fan starts to run, it will \"latch\" on and continue to run until the compressor is turned off. \nDo not run the compressor for less than 15-minute increments.  Short run times will increase \nwater / moisture content in the compressor system.  Water and moisture will adversely affect the \nlife of the compressor. \nCAUTION  \nOperating this unit in excess of 8500 rpm will void the warranty and will shorten the normal \nservice life of the compressor. \nCompressor Shut-Down  \na Turn off the compressor using the power switch. \nb Disengage the hydraulic pump / PTO. \nc Once the drive motor stops, the compressor will purge itself of air.  This \"blowdown cycle\" \ntypically requires approximately 45 seconds. It will not purge the reservoir tank, but only \nthe compressor unit.  During the blowdown cycle, the compressor will not restart if turned \non.  If the power switch is turned on, the compressor will not restart until the blowdown \ncycle is complete. \nd If the compressor is mounted on a vehicle, and the vehicle needs to be moved, work is \ncompleted for the day, or the compressor needs maintenance, you must relieve all pressure from the system.  Turn off the compressor normally and allow the blowdown \ncycle to complete.  Then, drain all air using the service valve located on the truck.  Close \nthe valve once the air release is complete. \nWARNING  \nFederal law prohibits moving a compressor without first releasing all air.   \n Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Operation 35 \n \nSub-Zero Temperature Operating Instructions \nFor IMT rotary screw compressors (both sha ft driven and hydraulically driven) sub-zero \ntemperature operation is defined as operation of the compressor when the oil temperature is below 0º F.  It is possible to operate an IM T rotary screw compressor when the ambient \ntemperature is below 0º F, as long as the oil temperature is above 0° F.  Follow these guidelines \nto protect the compressor: \n1 MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS \nIf the IMT rotary screw compressor is expected to  operate at temperatures below 0º F, the oil \nfilter, coalescer, air filter, and oil should be changed before the compressor is run in sub-zero \ntemperatures (ex: late fall, but this may vary by location and environment).   Performing this \nmaintenance will improve the performance of the system during sub-zero temperature \noperation.  Use only IMT approved rotary screw compressor oils and filters. \n2 STORAGE REQUIREMENTS \nThe IMT rotary screw compressor should be stored at or above 0º F.  If the ambient \ntemperature is below 0º F the vehicle s hould be stored inside, preferably in a heated \nenvironment.  After moving the vehicle from the heated environment, the compressor system \nshould be operated for 15 minutes before proceeding to a job site.  During this time, the service valve must be slightly ajar such that the pressure gauge reads between 100 and 125 psi.  This ensures that the oil temperature has had adequate time to come up to operating temperature, and that most of the water in the system has been removed.  This will allow for \napproximately one hour of travel time before th e oil cools to ambient temperature.  If an \nextended driving time is expected, the operator  may need to stop driving and run the system \nfor 15 minutes every hour to ensure that the oil temperature does not cool to below 0º F.  The operator should use his/her judgment when deciding what interval is needed between running the compressor to warm the oil.  Lower ambient temperature will require more \nfrequent warming of the compressor oil. \n3 FAILURE TO FOLLOW MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS \nAt temperatures below 0º F, failure to follow the guidelines may result overheating of the \ncompressor due to the oil’s inability to circulate through the compressor system.   The lack of circulation leads to rapid warming of the compressor air end, and eventually the compressor air end will exceed the maximum operating temperature.  If the system shuts down due to \nhigh temperature during sub-zero temperature operation, the oil will need to be warmed \nbefore restarting.  This may require moving the vehicle to a heated location or waiting for the ambient temperature (and therefore the oil temperature) to exceed 0º F. \nCAUTION \nFailure to adhere to these guidelines and repeated running of the compressor to high \ntemperature shutdown may result in permanent damage to the air end. \n Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  37 \n \nThis section contains instructions for performing the inspection, lubrication, and maintenance \nprocedures required to maintain the compressor in proper operating condition.  The importance of performing the maintenance described herein cannot be over emphasized. \nThe periodic maintenance procedures to be performed on the equipment covered by this manual \nare listed below.  It should be understood that t he intervals between inspections specified are \nmaximum interval.  More frequent inspections should be made if the unit is operating in a dusty \nenvironment, in high ambient temperature, or in other unusual conditions.  A planned program of \nperiodic inspection and maintenance will help avoided premature failure and costly repairs.  Daily visual inspections should become a routine. \nThe LUBRICATION AND MAINTENANCE CHART lists serviceable items on this compressor \npackage.  The items are listed according to their frequency of maintenance, followed by those \nitems which need only “As Required” maintenance. \nThe maintenance time intervals are expressed in hours.  The hourmeter shows the total number \nof hours your compressor has run.  Use the hourmeter readings for determining your maintenance schedules.  Perform the maintenance at multiple intervals of the hours shown.  For example, when the hourmeter shows “100” on the dial, all items listed under “EVERY 10 \nHOURS” should be serviced for the tenth time, and all items under “EVERY 50 HOURS” should \nbe serviced for the second time, and so on. \nDANGER  \nCompressor must be shut down and completely relieved of pressure prior to checking fluid \nlevels.  Open drain valve on air tank, and compresso r service valve, to ensure relief of system \nair pressure.  Failure to comply with this warning may cause damage to property and serious \nbodily harm. \n  SECTION 4 \nMaintenance & Repair Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n 38 IMT CAS2545 Air Compressor Manual Part No. 99904145 \n \n \nMaintenance Schedule \nMAINTENANCE OPERATION SERVICE INTERVAL (Hours/Months) \n DAILY WEEKLY 250/3 500/6 1000/12 \nAir end oil level - check, add if needed      \nAir receiver - drain condensation      \nCheck fittings and air lines for leaks      \nInspect air/oil cooler.

Then, check belt tension and condition every 250 hours / 3 \nmonths. \n \n2) Under normal operating conditions, oil changes are required every 3 months.  When operating in a dirty \nenvironment, change the oil and air filter  more frequently as your particula r operating conditions dictate.   \n \n Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Maintenance & Repair 39 \n \nCAS2545 Maintenance Procedures \nMaintenance intervals in the schedule outlined in this manual are based on one hour of \ncompressor operation equal to about 40 road miles on an engine.  Thus, eight hours operation is equal to 320 road miles, 250 hours is equal to 10,000 road miles, etc. \nOnly inspection processes can be completed with the compressor covers on.  To complete any \nmaintenance procedures, the covers must be removed. \nLIFTING COMPRESSOR \nA hole with 5/8-11 UNC threads is provided on the top of the compressor.  This threaded hole is designed to be used with an eyehook or lifting hook to lift the compressor.  Lift hooks or eyehooks with a rating of at least 600 pounds must be provided by the customer. \nCOMPRESSOR OIL SUMP FILL, LEVEL, AND DRAIN \nCHECKING COMPRESSOR OIL LEVEL \nThe proper compressor oil level, when unit is shut down and has had time to settle, is level to the top of the oil fill opening.  The truck must be level both side to side and front to back when \nchecking the oil.   \nMAX\nMINOIL FILL LEVEL -\nBETWEEN MINIMUM\nAND MAXIMUM LINES\nAS SHOWN.\nCAS2545 OIL FILL LEVEL \nADDING OIL TO COMPRESSOR \n1 Before adding or changing compressor oil, completely drain air tank and relieve pressure by \nopening pressure relief valve.   \n2 Remove filler cap and add new oil until the maximum limit is reached.  Oil can be added at \nthe oil fill opening.   \n3 Replace filler cap. \n4 Close pressure relief valve. Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n 40 IMT CAS2545 Air Compressor Manual Part No. 99904145 \n \nCHANGING COMPRESSOR OIL \n1 Run compressor until oil temperature is 100° - 122° F (40° - 50° C).  Then, completely drain \nair tank and relieve pressure by opening pressure relief valve.   \n2 Remove filler cap.  Open drain valve and drain oil, making sure to follow local and state \nregulations on waste oil collection and disposal. \n3 Close drain valve.  Add oil as described in the section, \"Adding Oil to Compressor.\" \n4 Replace oil fill cap. \n5 Close pressure relief valve and open shut-off valve between compressor and compressed-\nair system. \nDANGER  \nDo not attempt to drain condensate, remove the oil level fill plug, or break any connection in \nthe air or oil system without first shutting off compressor and manually relieving pressure from \nthe sump and air storage tank.  Failure to comply with this warning may cause damage to \nproperty and seriously bodily harm. \nNOTE  \nThe screw-on cap for the oil inlet pipe includes a lateral safety opening which air or oil may \npenetrate in case of residual pressure in the separator receiver.  Wait until the residual \npressure is relieved prior to checking the oil level. \nThe compressor cannot be overfilled with oil.  Excess oil will run out the oil fill tube. \nAIR INTAKE FILTER \nThe air intake filter is a heavy-duty two-stage dry type high efficiency filter designed to protect \nthe compressor from dust and foreign objects.  The filter is equipped with an evacuator cup for \ncontinuous dust ejection while operating and when stopped.  Frequency of maintenance of the filter depends on dust conditions at the operating site.  The filter element must be serviced when clogged (maximum pressure drop for proper operation is 15” H\n20).  The filter is equipped with a \npressure drop indicator.  Change the element based on the pressure drop indicator reading, at least as frequently as outlined in the maintenance schedule. \nPURIFIER/SEPARATOR CARTRIDGE \nThe purifier cartridge is the air/oil separating element of the screw compressor unit.  The cartridge, which is connected to the filter support of the separator tank using a fitting, must be \nchanged at least once per year, after 3,000 to 6,000 operating hours, or as soon as the \ndifferential pressure is more than 14 psi (1 bar)  If the intake air is highly contaminated or the oil quality is poor, the cartridge will clog and may have to be replaced sooner.  The purifier cartridge screws on to the filter support of the separator tank via a fitting.   \n1 Shut down compressor and wait for complete blow down (zero pressure).  Also, completely \ndrain air tank. Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Maintenance & Repair 41 \n \n2 Unscrew the cartridge by turning counterclockwise with an oil filter tool. \n3 Screw in the new purifier cartridge by hand.  Do not use a tool or wrench. \n4 Check whether the cartridge is tight.  Do not overtighten! \n5 Dispose of the used cartridge following local, state and federal regulations. \n6 Run system.  Check for leaks. \n7 Enter cartridge change in maintenance log. \nNOTE  \nWhen connecting drain line, hold canister nut securely when tightening the hose fitting. \nWARNING  \nDo not substitute element.  Use only a genuine IMT replacement element.  This element is \nrated at 200 psi working pressure.  Use of any other element may be hazardous and could \nimpair the performance and reliability of the compressor, possibly voiding the warranty and/or \nresulting in damage to property and serious bodily harm. \n \nOIL FILTER \nThe compressor oil filter is a spin-on, throw away type.  After replacing filter, dispose of used \nfilter according to local and state hazardous waste regulations. \nTo replace filter: \n1 Make sure system pressure is relieved. \n2 Remove filter by unscrewing from filter head (turn counterclockwise by hand) and discard. Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n 42 IMT CAS2545 Air Compressor Manual Part No. 99904145 \n \n3 Install a new filter by applying a little oil to the seal and then screw the filter on by hand \n(turning it clockwise until hand tight, plus one - third turn).  Do not use tools to tighten the filter. \n4 Check for leaks in operation. \n5 Re-check compressor oil level. \nWARNING  \nDo not substitute element.  Use only a genuine IMT replacement element.  This element is \nrated at 200 psi working pressure.  Use of any other element may be hazardous and could \nimpair the performance and reliability of the compressor, possibly voiding the warranty and/or \nresulting in damage to property and serious bodily harm. \nOIL COOLER \nThe interior of the oil cooler should be cleaned when the pressure drop across it at full flow \nexceeds 25 psi.   \nThe following procedure has been recommended by  the vendor who supplies the cooler: \n1 Remove cooler. \n2 Circulate a suitable solvent to dissolve and remove varnish and sludge. \n3 Flush generously with IMT compressor lubricant. \n4 After cooler is reinstalled and compressor is filled with fresh oil, change compressor oil afer \n50 hours of normal operation. \n \nBELT TENSION \nTension belt as follows: \n1 With hydraulic motor mounting bolts loose, install belt. \n2 Spread pulleys by hand, roughly tensioning belt. \n3 Install tensioning tool (IMT # 92720758) between pulleys.  Rotate center section to spread \npulleys apart. \n4 Place straightedge across top of pulleys with long edge perpendicular to belt.  Push on top of \nbelt to a deflection of 0.141\".  Measure force using belt tension gauge 79733864.  The belt tension at a span of 9\" (center-to-center between motor shaft and compressor input shaft), with a deflection of 0.141\", should be 10 to 12 lb force. \n5 With tool still in place, tighten motor mount bolts.  Release tool. \n6 Re-check belt deflection and force with gauge.  Adjust as necessary. Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Maintenance & Repair 43 \n \nThe ideal tension is the lowest tension at which the belt will not slip under peak load conditions.  \nCheck the tension frequently during the first 24-48 hours of operation.  Over tensioning shortens \nthe belt and bearing life.  Keep belts free from foreign material which may cause slip.  Inspect V-\nbelts regularly.  Tension when slipping.  Never apply belt dressing as this will damage the belt \nand cause early failure. \n92720758\nTENSIONING\nTOOL\nREF 99904148 REV A  20070220  Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n 44 IMT CAS2545 Air Compressor Manual Part No. 99904145 \n \nBELT SHEAVE/PULLEY ALIGNMENT AND CONDITION \nCheck Condition of Sheaves.  Before a new set of V-belts are installed, check the condition of the \nsheaves.  Dirty or rusty sheaves impair the drive efficiency and abrade the belts, which results in premature failure.  Worn sheaves shorten the belt life as much as 50 percent.  If the grooves are worn such that the belt bottoms out, slippage may result and burn the belts.  If the sidewalls are \"dished out\", the bottom shoulder ruins the belts prematurely by wearing off the bottom corners. \nCheck Sheave Alignment .  Sheave adjustment should be checked by placing a straight edge or \ntight cord across the sheave face so it touches all four points of contact.  A misalignment of more than 1/2° (1/8\") per 12\" of distance will adverse ly affect belt life.  Improper sheave alignment \nproduces uneven wear on one side of the belt, caus es the belt to roll over in the sheaves, or \nthrows all of the load on one side of the belt, stretching or breaking the cords on that side. \n1/4\" GAP BETWEEN\nBACK FACE OF PULLEY\nAND MOTOR MOUNT FACESTRAIGHT\nEDGE\nREF 99904148 REV A 20070220  \nInstalling Belts on Sheaves.   Shorten the center distance of the drive until the belts can be put on \nthe sheaves without force.  Forcing the belts can damage them. \nBelt Selection.   For best service, replace V-belt drives with a complete new matched set of belts.  \nNever replace one of a set belts with a used belt, as used belts are worn in cross-section and stretched.  If a single belt fails, the entire set of belts should be replaced.  A new belt will ride higher in the sheave, will travel faster, and operate at a much higher tension than the used belts.  Mixing new and used belts can cause cord rupture in the new belts, which allows the new belts to elongate.  If the cord in a new belt ruptures, the new belt will fail to carry its full share of the \nload, and the drive will be under-belted.  Belts from different manufacturers should not be mixed, \neither, for the same reasons. \n \n Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \n  Maintenance & Repair 45 \n \nLubricant Recommendations \nWARNING  \nAVOID INJURY OR EQUIPMENT DAMAGE! \nUse IMT-recommended compressor oil.  Inspect and replace oil, air filter, oil filter, and \ncoalescer elements as stated in this manual. \nThe combination of a coalescer element loaded with dirt and oxidized oil products together \nwith increased air velocity as a result of this clogged condition may produce a critical point \nwhile the machine is in operation where ignition can take place and could cause a fire in the \noil sump. \nThe following are general characteristics for IMT rotary screw lubricant.  It is impossible to \nestablishing limits on all physical and chemical pr operties of lubricants which can affect their \nperformance in the compressor over a broad range of environmental influences, so the \nresponsibility for recommending and consistently fu rnishing a suitable heavy duty lubricant must \nrest with the individual supplier if they choose not to use the recommended IMT rotary screw lubricant.  The lubricant supplier’s recommendation must, therefore, be based upon not only the following general characteristics, but also upon his own knowledge of the suitability of the recommended lubricant in helical screw type air compressors operating in the particular \nenvironment involved.  The owner of this equipment  should contact the factory if IMT rotary \nscrew lubricant is not used as supplied with this equipment. \nCAUTION  \nWe do not recommend mixing different types or brands  of lubricants, due to the possibility of a \ndilution of the additives or reaction between additives of different types. \nLUBRICANT SPECIFICATIONS \nIMT specified rotary screw lubricant shipped with your kit contains additives for rust, corrosion \nand anti-wear inhibitors.  Use of any other lubricant is not recommended. \n1 Flash point 450°F minimum \n2 Pour point -55°F. \n3 Contains rust and corrosion inhibitors. \n4 Contains foam suppressors. \n5 Contains oxidation stabilizer.

When the oil temperature reaches 180° F, the Fan relay turns on, indicating that the \nfan is on.  The fan will \"latch\" on and stay on until the compressor is shut down. \nHigh Temperature Shut-Down  \nWhen a high temperature situation occurs, with a temperature above 240° F, the Power relay will \nturn off and the Hi-Temp and Hyd Sol  relays will light, indicating high temperatures.  The lighted \nswitch on the user control panel will also light.  The fan will stay on if it was already on. \nTo reset, push the lighted pushbutton switch on the control panel.  This will reset all switches to \nnormal condition ( Enable  and Power  relays will be on) and the compressor will restart.  If there is \nstill a problem, the unit will shut down again once the temperature reaches 240° F. \nNOTE: Even if the reset switch is pressed, the light will stay on and the unit will not restart until \nthe temperature has dropped.

If possible, \nthe Compressor should be located in a \nseparate room or area, away from the general operations of the shop. \n \n Allow a minimum of 18” (458mm) around and 3 \nfeet (915mm) above the Unit for easy access to \nthe various sides, this being for both the proper \nventilation of the Unit and ease of servicing. \n \n Ensure that the floor under the Unit is smooth, \nlevel and capable of bearing the weight of the \nCompressor. The Compressor must sit \nsquarely on the floor. \n \n If installed in a compressor room, ensure that the \nroom is adequately ventilated. (One Horsepower produces approximately 2500 \nBTU/HR.) See Pages 8 and 9. \n \n The ambient temperature should be between \n50°F and 104°F (10°C to 40°C).  If installing the Unit on a mezzanine, ensure that \nthe structure can safely  support the weight of \nthe Unit. As well, the sound level of the Unit \nmay increase due to the harmonics created by the structure; use Vibration Pads to lessen this. \n \n Many common Compressor problems can be \nattributed to the location or installation of the Unit. \nMake sure the Unit is in a suitable location, and installed correctly. ‘A’ Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com  manuals search engine  \nG2030-II-C \nMar ‘17 \n - 8 -Installation – Mechanical (cont’d) \n \nShown below and on the following page are items which assist in making a good installation.

Top up \nthe Oil level on a monthly basis.  \nUse only DV Systems ‘ DEV-3000 ’ Synthetic Oil. Also,  \ndo not mix the ‘DEV-3000’ with any other lubricant. \n \nSubsequent Oil Changes. \nDrain the existing oil from the Unit. (Please be \nadvised that the Unit cannot be drained fully of oil, as \nsome oil may remain in various components ie \nCooler, Tubing, etc.)  \nFill the Oil Reservoir to the Metal Band on the \nExternal Oil Level Gauge as shown below. Do not under or overfill. See drawing below. \n \nUse only DV Systems ‘ DEV-3000 ’ Synthetic Oil, \navailable in both 1 US gallon (3.8 litre) jugs or 5 US \ngallon (5 x 3.8 litre) pails.

The cooled air is further co mpressed in high-pressure compressor element (Eh) \nand discharged through pulsation damper (AS) and afte rcooler (15).  A check valve (CV) is provided \ndownstream of the pulsation damper. \n \n \n1.3 Condensate drain system (Figs. 1.6/1.7) \nTwo condensate traps are installed: one downstream of the intercooler (MTi) to prevent condensate \nfrom entering the high-pressure compressor elem ent (Eh) and one downstream of the aftercooler \n(MTa) to prevent condensate from entering the air outlet pipe. The condensate traps are provided with \na float valve to automatically drain co ndensate and with a manual drain valve. \n For Full-Feature compressors with an ID dryer (F igs. 1.6), the condensate trap downstream the \naftercooler is replaced by a condensate trap (5) in the dryer.   \n Full-Feature compressors with an IMD dryer (Figs. 1.7) have three additional electronic water drains: \n- One on the IMD \n- One upstream and downstream the regeneration air cooler  \n \n1.4 Oil system (Figs. 1.6/1.7) \nOil is circulated by pump (OP) from the sump of the gear casing through cooler (16) and oil filter (OF) \ntowards the bearings and timing gears. \n The oil system is protected by a valve that opens if the oil pressure should rise above a given value.  \nThe valve is located in the oil filter housing. \n  \n1.5 Cooling system (Figs. 1.6/1.7) \nZT compressors  \nThe compressors are provided with an air-cooled oil c ooler (16), intercooler (11) and aftercooler (15).  \nAn electric motor-driven fan (F N) generates the cooling air. \n \nZR compressors \nThe oil cooler, intercooler and aftercooler are water-cooled. \nThe water system includes three parallel circuits: - One for the oil cooler and intercooler. \n- One for the aftercooler. \n- One circuit is only for compressors with an IMD dryer and contains the regeneration cooler. Each of these circuits has a separate regulating valve (see section 3.1) \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  11 TVY1\nUSUV CM\n12 UA\nAIR INLET (1)\nAIR FLOW (2)\nOIL FLOW (3)43\nOPAIR OUTLET (5)M2 FN1\n15\n1116\nAF\nAS\nSVl\nMTiCVF1 F2 F3Elektronikon \nEWDiEhElOFAV\nREFRIGERANT FLUID (6)\nREFRIGERANT GAS (7)6\n7\n5\n13\n10\nFN2M38\n12\n9\n55347DSVh\n \nFig. 1.6a ZT compressors with an ID dryer \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  12 AF\nTV\nY1\nUSUV\nAS\nCVCM\n12 UA\nAIR INLET (1)\nAIR FLOW (2)\nOIL FLOW (3)\nWATER FLOW (4)43\nOP\nEhElOF\nAIR OUTLET (5)F1 F2 F3Elektronikon \n11\n151617\n1819\n14SVl\nSVhAVREFRIGIRANT FLUID\nREFRIGERANT GAS\n6\n7\n5\n8 12\n10\nFN1M313\n55346DEWDi(6)\n(7)\n9MTi\n \n \nFig. 1.6b ZR compressors with an ID dryer  \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  13  \nAF Air filter \nAS Pulsation damper AV Air outlet valve (customer’s installation) \nCM Control module \nCV Check valve Eh High-pressure compressor element \nEl Low-pressure compressor element \nEWDi Electronic drain, low-pressure element FN1 Fan, compressor coolers \nFN2 Fan, condenser \nM2 Fan motor, compressor coolers M3 Refrigerant compressor \nMTi Condensate trap, intercooler \nOF Oil filter OP Oil pump \nSVh Safety valve, high-pressure element \nSVi Safety valve, low-pressure element TV Load/no-load valve \nUA Unloader \nUS Silencer \nY1 Loading solenoid valve \n1 Chamber 2 Plunger \n3 Chamber \n4 Diaphragm 5 Condensate trap, dryer \n6 Air/air heat exchanger \n7 Air/refrigerant heat exchanger/evaporator 8 Capillary tube \n9 Accumulator \n10 Refrigerant condenser 11 Intercooler \n12 Hot-gas by-pass valve \n13 Liquid refrigerant filter/dryer 14 Water outlet valve (customer’s installation) \n15 Aftercooler \n16 Oil cooler 17 Regulating valve, oil cooler and intercooler water circuit \n18 Regulating valve, aftercooler water circuit \n19 Water inlet valve (customer’s installation)  \nNote:  References 14 up to 19 apply to ZR compressors only \n \nFigs. 1.6 Flow diagrams/regulating systems fo r Full-Feature compressors with ID dryer \n \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  14 TVY1\nUSUV CM\n12 UA\nAIR INLET (1)\nAIR FLOW (2)\nOIL FLOW (3)43\nOPAIR OUTLET (5)13 FN1\n15\n1116SVh\nMTa\nAF\nAS\nSVl\nMTiCV\n55365DF1 F2 F3Elektronikon \nEWDiEhElOF10\n129\n14\n17181920215 628\n2929\n26\n27AV\n227 8\n \n \nFig. 1.7a ZT compressor with IMD dryer  \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  15 AF\nTV\nY1\nUSUV\nAS\nCVCM\n12 UA\nAIR INLET (1)\nAIR FLOW (2)\nOIL FLOW (3)\nWATER FLOW (4)43\nOP\nEhElOF\nAIR OUTLET (5)F1 F2 F3Elektronikon \n55364D7 8\n10\n129\n14\n17181920215 628\n2929\n26\n27AV11\n15\n221623\n24\n2531\n30SVl\nSVhMTi\nEWDi\nMTa\n \n \n \nFig. 1.7b ZR compressor with IMD dryer \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  16 AF Air filter \nAS Pulsation damper \nAV Air outlet valve (customer’s installation) CM Elektronikon regulator \nCV Check valve \nEh High-pressure compressor element El Low-pressure compressor element \nEWDi Electronic water drain, intercooler \nFN1 Cooling fan MTa Condensate trap, aftercooler \nMTi Condensate trap, intercooler \nOF Oil filter OP Oil pump \nSVh High-pressure safety valve \nSVl Low-pressure safety valve TV Load/no-load valve \nUA Unloader \nUS Silencer UV Unloading valve \nY1 Loading solenoid valve \n1 Chamber \n2 Plunger \n3 Chamber 4 Diaphragm \n5 Valve for (+) connection, pressure difference gauge \n6 Valve for (-) connection, pressure difference gauge \n7 Throttle valve, regeneration inlet air \n8 Shut-off valve, hot regeneration inlet air \n9 Strainer 10 Sealing sector, regeneratio n air inlet (unsaturated side) \n11 Intercooler \n12 Rotor 13 Fan motor, air coolers \n14 Ejector \n15 Aftercooler 16 Oil cooler  \n17 Electronic water drain, inlet air \n18 Water separator, inlet air 19 Demister \n20 Rotor sealing arrangement \n21 Dry air outlet compartment 22 Regeneration air cooler \n23 Regulating valve, oil cooler and intercooler water circuit \n24 Regulating valve, aftercooler water circuit \n25 Regulating valve, regeneration air cooler water circuit \n26 IMD air inlet valve 27 IMD by-pass valve \n28 IMD outlet valve \n29 Electronic drains, regeneration air cooler 30 Water shut-off valve, water outlet (customer’s installation) \n31 Shut-off valve, water inle t (customer’s installation) \n  \nFigs. 1.7 Flow diagram/regulating system, ZT Full-Feature with IMD dryer \n  \n \n \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  17 1.6 Air dryer on Full-Feature  \nFull-Feature compressors are provided with a drye r which removes moisture from compressed air. \nTwo dryer types are available: a refrigerant-type dryer (ID dryer) and an adsorption-type dryer (IMD \ndryer).    \n1.6.1 Compressors with an ID dryer (Figs. 1.6) Compressed air circuit of the dryer \nCompressed air enters heat exchanger (6) and is co oled by the outgoing dried air.  Water in the \nincoming air starts to condense.  The air then flow s through heat exchanger/evaporator (7) where the \nrefrigerant evaporates, causing the air to be further cooled to close to the evaporating temperature of \nthe refrigerant.  More water in the air condenses.  The cold air then flows through condensate trap (5), \nwhere all the condensate is separated from the ai r.  The condensate collects in the condensate trap \nand is automatically drained.  The cold, dried air fl ows through heat exchanger (6), where it is warmed \nup by the incoming air.   \n \nRefrigeration circuit of the dryer \nCompressor (M3) delivers high-pressure refrigerant  gas, which flows through condenser (10) where \nmost of the refrigerant condenses.  \nThe liquid flows through liquid refrigerant dryer/filter (13) to capillary tube (8).  The refrigerant leaves \nthe capillary tube at evaporating pressure.  \nThe refrigerant enters evaporator (7) where it wi thdraws heat from the compressed air by further \nevaporation at constant pressure.  The heated refrig erant leaves the evaporator  and is sucked in by \nthe compressor. \n \n1.6.2 Compressors with an IMD dryer (Figs. 1.7) \n \nAir drying circuit of the dryer \nWet air from the aftercooler (15) enters the drye r through inlet valve (26) and the nozzle of ejector \n(14). The air leaving the aftercooler is normally saturated. \n \nIn the demister (18), water droplets are removed from the air.  The air is then led through rotor (19), \nwhich adsorbs the water vapour.  The dried ai r leaves the dryer through outlet valve (28). \n \nRegeneration air circuit of the dryer \nHot unsaturated regeneration air flows through shut -off valve (8) and throttle valve (7) through the wet \nrotor channels (12).  Since the hot air has a lower vapour pressure than the wet rotor channels, it will dry the rotor. \n \nThe hot saturated air is then cooled down in regeneration air cooler (22) and led to the suction chamber of ejector (14), where it is mixed with the wet compressed air from the compressor \naftercooler.   \n \nDrain system of the dryer \nThe condensate is collected in three EWD (Electroni c Water Drains-Fig. 1.8).  A sensor continuously \nmeasures the liquid level.  As soon as the collect or is filled up to a certain level, the outlet opens, \ndischarging the condensate. When the collector ha s been emptied, the outlet closes quickly without \nwasting compressed air. \n If the controller registers a malfunction, the red alar m LED (Fig. 1.8) starts flashing and the electronic \ndrain valve will automatically change to the alarm mode, opening and closing the valve according to a \nbuilt-in sequence.  This condition continues until t he fault is remedied. If the fault is not remedied \nautomatically, maintenance is required.  Co nsult your Atlas Copco Customer Centre. \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  18 Testing the EWD \n \nFunctional test \nBriefly press the TEST button (Fig. 1.8) and che ck that the valve opens for condensate discharge. \n \nChecking the alarm signal \n- Press the test button for at least 1 minute - Check that the alarm LED flashes \n- Release the test button.  \n \n \nFig. 1.8 Control panel of Electronic Water Drain (EWD) \n \n \n1.7 Electrical system \nThe system mainly includes:  - Elektronikon regulator (1-Fig. 1.1) \n- Emergency stop button (S3-Fig. 1.1) \n- Electric cabinet (Fig. 1.9) - Drive motor (M1-Fig. 1.2) \n- Pressure and temperature sensors \n  \n  \n  \n \n F1/2 Fuses \nF4/5/6 Fuses \nF21 Overload relay, drive motor \nK21 Line contactor \nK22 Star contactor K23 Delta contactor \nQ15 Circuit breaker, fan motor (on ZT) \nT1 Main transformer T2 Transformer, control circuit \n1X1/4/5/6 Terminal strips \n Fig. 1.9  Electric cabinet, typical \nexample \n \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  19 1.8 Elektronikon control system \nIn general, the Elektronikon regulator has following functions: \n- automatic control of the compressor \n- protecting the compressor - monitoring components - service warning \n- automatic restart after voltage failure \n \n1.8.1 Automatic control of the compressor \nThe regulator maintains the net pressure between programmable limits by aut omatically loading and \nunloading the compressor.  A number of programmable settings, e.g. the unloading and loading pressures, the minimum stop time and the maximum number of motor starts are taken into account. \n \nThe regulator stops the compressor whenever possible  to reduce the power consumption and restarts \nit automatically when the net pressu re decreases.  In case the expected stopping period is too short, \nthe compressor is kept running to prevent too-short standstill periods. \n Warning \nA number of time-based automatic start/stop command s may be programmed.  Take into account that \na start command will be executed (if programmed an d activated), even after manually stopping the \ncompressor. \n \n1.8.2 Protecting the compressor \nShut-down and motor overload \nSeveral temperature and pressure sensors are provided on the compressor.  If one of these \nmeasurements (temperature at LP element outlet, temperature at HP element outlet, intercooler \npressure as well as oil pressure) exceeds the programmed shut -down level, the compressor will be \nstopped.  This will be indica ted on the control display. \n \nThe compressor will also be stopped in case of overload of the drive motor. \n Consult the safety precautions as mentioned in sect ion 4 and remedy the trouble.  See also the User \nmanual for Elektronikon regulator, section “Status data menu”. \n Shut-down warning \nIf the regulator detects a temperature or pressure ju st below the programmed shut-down level, this will \nbe indicated on the control panel to warn the oper ator before the shut-down level is reached. \n \nThe message disappears as soon as the warning condition disappears.  \n1.8.3 Service warning \nA number of service operations are grouped (called Le vel A, B, C, ...).  Each level has a programmed \ntime interval.  If a time interval is exceeded, a me ssage will appear on display (2-Fig. 1.10) to warn the \noperator to carry out the service actions belonging to that level.  See section 4. \n \n1.8.4 Automatic restart after voltage failure \nThe regulator has a built-in function to automatically  restart the compressor if the voltage is restored \nafter voltage failure.  For compressors leaving the fact ory, this function is ma de inactive.  If desired, \nthe function can be activated.

If the power re covery time is set to \nInfinite, the compressor will always restart after a voltage failure, no matter how long it takes to restore \nthe voltage.  A restart delay can also be programm ed, allowing e.g. two compressors to be restarted \none after the other.  \n \n1.9 Control panel \n \n \n \nFig. 1.10  Control panel \n \n1.9.1 LEDs/buttons/keys \n \nRef.

Description \n \n1. Install the compressor on a level floor, suitable for taking its weight.  Recommended minimum \ndistance between the top of t he bodywork and the ceiling: 1200 mm. \n \n2. Remove the plastic plug (if provided) from the compressor air outlet pipe and install an air \noutlet valve.  Close the valve and connect it to the air net. \n \n3. The pressure drop over the deliver y pipe can be calculated as follows: \n \n dp = (L x 450 x Qc1.85) / (d5 x P) \n  dp = pressure drop (recommended maximum = 0.1 bar) \n L = length of delivery pipe in m \n d = inner diameter of the delivery pipe in mm  P = absolute pressure at the compressor outlet in bar(a) \n Qc = free air delivery of the compressor in l/s \n  The connection of the compressor air delivery pipe should be made on top of the main air net \npipe to minimize carry-over of possible remainder of condensate. \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  31  \n4. The inlet grids and ventilation fan should be insta lled in such a way that any recirculation of \ncooling air to the compressor is avoided.  The air velocity to the grids should be limited to 5 \nm/s.  The required ventilation capacity (per compre ssor installed) to limit the compressor room \ntemperature can be calculated as follows: \n  Qv = 1.16 N / dT for ZT15 up to ZT22 \n Qv = (1.16 N + 3.2) / dT for ZT15 up to ZT22 Full-Feature \n Qv = 1.09 N / dT for ZT30 up to ZT45  Qv = (1.09 N + 5.5) / dT for ZT30 up to ZT45 Full-Feature \n Qv = 0.21 N / dT for ZR30 up to ZR45 \n Qv = (0.21 N + 5.5) / dT for ZR30 up to ZR45 Full-Feature  \nQv = required ventilation capacity in m³/s \nN = shaft input of the compressor in kW dT = temperature rise over ambient  \n \n If cooling air ducts are installed, the maximu m allowable pressure drop over the ducts is 30 \nPa.  Common ducting for several compressors is not allowed. \n \n5. Lay out the drain piping from automatic condensate outlets to wards the condensate collector.  \nThe drain pipes must not dip into the water of the collector.  It is recommended to provide a \nfunnel to allow visual inspection of the condensate flow. \n \n6. Elektronikon control system with control panel. \n 7. See section 2.3 for the recommended cable si ze of the supply cables.  Check that the \nelectrical connections correspond to the local codes.  The installation must be earthed and \nprotected against short circuits by fuses in all phases.  An isolating switch must be installed \nnear the compressor. \n \n8. Provide a condensate drain valve in the lowe st part of the pipe between the compressor outlet \nvalve and the air net. \n \n9. On ZT : optional main switch. \n \n9. On ZR30 up to ZR45 : position of cooling water pipes.  Remove the plastic plugs (if provided) \nfrom the compressor water pipes and connect the pipes to the cooling water circuit.

In the latter \ncase, the composition of the wate r that enters the cooler must be considered, and not the composition \nof the make-up water.  Due to t he evaporative effect in the cooling tower, much higher concentrations \nof ions can be obtained in the circulat ing water than in the make-up water. \n \n2.5.2 Cooling water parameters \n \nThe Ryznar stability index (RSI) \nThe Ryznar Index (RSI) is a paramet er for predicting whether water will tend to dissolve or precipitate \ncalcium carbonate.  The adhesion of scaling deposits and their effect are different on different \nmaterials, but the equilibrium of the water (scaling or  corrosive) is only deter mined by its actual pH \nvalue and by the saturation pH value (pHs).  The sa turation pH value is determined by the relationship \nbetween the calcium hardness, the total alkalinity, the total solids concentration and the temperature. \n The Ryznar Index is calculated as follows: \n \nRSI = 2*pH\ns - pH \n \nwhere pH = measured pH (at room temperature) of water sample \n pH s = pH at saturation \n \nThe pH s is calculated by using : \n  pH\ns= (9.3 + A + B) - (C + D) \n \n A : depends on the total solids concentration (mg/l).  \n B : depends on the highest cooling water temperature (°C).  For Z units take T = 65°C \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  40  \n C : depends on the calcium hardness (ppm CaCO 3). \n  D : depends on the HCO\n3- concentration or M- alkalinity (mval/l). \n \n The values from A, B, C and D are found in the table below.  \n \nTotal \ndissolved \nsolids   Temperature   Ca-\nhardness   M-Alkalinity   \n (mg/l) A (°C) B (ppm \nCaCO3) C (mval/l) D \n50 - 300 0.1 0 - 1 2.6 10 - 11 0.6 0.20 - 0.22 1.0 \n400 - \n1000 0.2 2 - 6 2.5 12 - 13 0.7 0.24 - 0.26 1.1 \n    7 - 9 2.4 14 - 17 0.8 0.28 - 0.34 1.2 \n    10 - 13 2.3 18 - 22 0.9 0.36 - 0.44 1.3 \n    14 - 17 2.2 23 - 27 1.0 0.46 - 0.54 1.4 \n    18 - 21 2.1 28 - 34 1.1 0.56 - 0.70 1.5 \n    22 - 27 2.0 35 - 43 1.2 0.72 - 0.88 1.6 \n    28 - 31 1.9 44 - 55 1.3 0.90 - 1.10 1.7 \n    32 - 37 1.8 56 - 69 1.4 1.12 - 1.38 1.8 \n    38 - 44 1.7 70 - 87 1.5 1.40 - 1.76 1.9 \n    45 - 50 1.6 88 - 110 1.6 1.78 - 2.20 2.0 \n    51 - 56 1.5 111 - 138 1.7 2.22 - 2.78 2.1 \n    57 - 63 1.4 138 - 174 1.8 2.80 - 3.54 2.2 \n    64 - 71 1.3 175 - 220 1.9 3.54 - 4.40 2.3 \n    72 - 80 1.2 230 - 270 2.0 4.6 - 5.4 2.4 \n        280 - 340 2.1 5.6 - 7.0 2.5 \n        350 - 430 2.2 7.2 - 8.8 2.6 \n        440 - 550 2.3 9.0 - 11.0 2.7 \n        560 - 690 2.4 11.2 - 13.8 2.8 \n        700 - 870 2.5 14.0 - 17.6 2.9 \n        880 - \n1000 2.6 17.8 - 20.0 3.0 \n \nThe interpretation of the values obtained is :  \n  RSI   <  6 boiler scale formation \n  RSI  6 – 7 neutral water   RSI   >  7 corrosive water \n \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  41 A more detailed interpretation follows below : \n \nRSI Tendency of the water Action \nRSI < 3.9 Very high scale formation Water cannot be used \n4.0 < RSI < 5.5 High boiler scale formation Regular control and descaling \noperation necessary \n5.6 < RSI < 6.2 Slight boiler scale fo rmation Water treatment not necessary \nOccasional inspection recommended    \n6.3 < RSI < 6.8 Neutral water Water treatment not necessary \nOccasional inspection recommended \n6.9 < RSI < 7.5 Slight corrosion at higher \ntemperature Water treatment not necessary \nOccasional inspection recommended \n7.6 < RSI < 9.0 Strong corrosion Re gular control necessary, use of \ncorrosion inhibitor recommended \n9.1 < RSI < 11 Very strong corrosi on Regular control necessary, use of \ncorrosion inhibitor required \nRSI > 11 Very strong corrosion in complete \nwater system Water should not be used \n \nThis table indicates that distilled or demineralised  water should never be used, as their RSI is > 11. \n \nThe RSI only indicates the equilibrium of scaling – descaling.  Cooling water showing good RSI \nconditions can still be unsuitable due to other factors. \n From the table above, the RSI index should be betw een 5.6 and 7.5; otherwise, contact a specialist. \n \npH \nThe effect of pH is already calculated in the Ryznar index, but the pH itself has some additional \nlimitations: \n Z-units   6.8 < pH < 8.5 \n \nTotal dissolved solids (TDS) \nThis is the sum of all ions in the water.  It can be derived from the dry residue after evaporation (but \nnot including suspended solids), or it can be estimated from the electrical conductivity. \n In a closed system, the following limits apply : \n \nAll units  TDS < 3000 mg/l (<3800 µS/cm)  \nFor an open system, the following limits apply : \n \nZ-units  TDS < 750 mg/l  ( < 580 µS/cm) \n \nChlorides (Cl\n-) \nChloride ions will create pitting corrosion on stainles s steel.  Their concentration should be limited: \n Closed cooling system: Chlorides < 500 ppm \nOpen cooling system: Chlorides < 150 ppm \n However, if the water is scaling, lower limits shou ld be used.  (See The Ryznar stability index (RSI)). \n \nFree chlorine (Cl\n2) \nContinuously, a level of 0.5 ppm should not be exceeded. For shock treatments, a maximum limit of 2 ppm for maximum 30 minutes/day applies. \n \nSulphates (SO4\n--) \nClosed cooling system: Sulphates < 400 ppm \nOpen cooling systems:  Sulphates < 150 ppm \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  42  \nCarbonate hardness \nClosed cooling system: 50-1000 ppm CaCO 3 \nOpen cooling system: 50-500 ppm CaCO 3 \n \nHCO 3- / SO 42- should be > 1 \n Ammonia \n< 0.5 ppm \n \nCopper < 1 ppm \n Iron and manganese \n< 1 ppm \n Organics \nNo algae. \nNo oil. \n \nSuspended solids \nNon-soluble particles, size < 1 mm. \n< 10 ppm. \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  43 3 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS \nSafety precautions \nThe operator must apply all related safety precauti ons, including those mentioned in this book. \n \nAmbient conditions  \nConsult section 7 for the limitations with regard to the ambient conditions and altitude operation. \n \nMoving/lifting \nThe compressor can be moved by a lift truck using th e slots in the frame.  Make sure that the forks \nprotrude from the other side of the frame.  The co mpressor can also be lifted after inserting beams in \nthe slots.  Make sure that the beams cannot slide an d that they protrude from the frame equally.  The \nchains must be held parallel to the bodywork by chain spreaders in order not to damage the \ncompressor.  The lifting equipment must be placed in such a way that  the compressor will be lifted \nperpendicularly.  Lift smoothly and avoid twisting. \n \n \n3.1 Initial start-up \n1. Read the User manual for Elektronikon regulat or to familiarize yourself with all regulator \nfunctions. \n2. Consult section 2 for the electric cable size , installation proposals and dimension drawings. \n3. A sticker dealing in short with the operation in structions is delivered with the literature set.  \nAffix the sticker next to the control panel. \n4. A number of VCI (Volatile Corrosion Inhibito r) plates may be provided inside the bodywork and \nelectric cabinet to protect the compresso r against corrosion.  Remove the plates. \n5. A silica gel bag is installed in the pipe  (3-see figure below) bet ween the intercooler \ncondensate trap and the high-pressure compress or element (a label is stuck on the pipe).  \nUnscrew the bolts of flange (1), remove couplin g (5) and take out the bag.

The compressor and motor ar e secured to the frame, immobilizing the vibration dampers \nduring transport (Figs. 3.1).  After installing the compressor: \na On earlier production units  (Fig. 3.1a) loosen the nuts (2 and 4) of the long central \nbolt of each damper, screw the bolts (1 and 3) as far out as indicated and tighten the \nnuts again. \nb On recent production units , remove the transport fixations (Fig. 3.1b), which are \npainted red. Unscrew bolt (1) and remove transpo rt  bush (5).  Four transport fixations \nare provided: two at the gear casing side and two at the motor side. \n7. Check that the gear casing is filled with oil:  the level should be in the middle of sight-glass \n(SG-Fig. 3.3). \n8. Check that the electrical connections correspon d to the local codes.  The installation must be \nearthed and protected by fuses in all phases .  An isolating switch must be provided. \n9. Check the connections at the primary sides of  transformers (T1 and T2-Fig. 1.9).  Check the \nsettings of circuit breaker (Q15) and overload relay (F21). \n10. Close the manual drain valve of the condensate trap (1-Fig. 3.5). \n \n On ZR only: 11. Check that the cooling water drain valves (cus tomer’s installation) in the inlet and outlet lines \nare closed. Open the water inlet and outlet valves (customer’s installation) and check for water \nflow.  Open the water flow regulating valves (1 and 4-Fig. 3.6 and 7-Fig. 3.7 in case of IMD). \n  On compressors with an IMD dryer only: \n12. Close the regeneration air inlet valve (2-Fig. 1. 5), as well as the air inlet and outlet valves (7 \nand 10-Fig. 1.5).  Open the by-pass valve (9-Fig. 1.5). \n13. Close the valves (1 and 3-Fig. 3.2a).  Fill a transparent tube halfway with water.  Install the \ntube to these valves. \n14. Close the manual drain valve (8-Fig. 1.5). \n \n \n \n1 Valve for + connection, pressure differential gauge \n2 Safety valve \n3 Valve for - connection, pressure differential gauge \n4 Adjusting screw  \nFig. 3.2a Components of IMD dryer, new version \n  \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3.2b U-Tube \n \n \n \n On all compressors: \n15. Switch on the voltage.   Start the compressor  and stop it immediately.  Check for correct \ndirection of rotation while the motor is coasti ng to a stop.  Arrow (1-Fig. 3.3) on the gear \ncasing indicates the correct rotation direction.  If  the rotation direction is wrong, switch off the \nvoltage and reverse two incoming electric lines.  On ZT , check the rotation direction of the fan \nmotor.  Cooling air must be blown through the outlet grating on the roof.  If the rotation \ndirection is wrong, switch off the voltage and re verse two connections at the terminals of \ncircuit breaker (Q15-Fig. 1.9). \nInstruction book \n2920 1472 03  46  \n \n On compressors with an IMD dryer only: \n16. Open the valve (customer’s installation) to the air net. 17. Start the compressor and blow off some air from the air net to keep the compressor running \nloaded. \n18. Slightly  open the dryer air inlet valve (7-Fig. 1.5) to pressurize the dryer.  Fully open the valve \nafter pressurizing. \n19. Open the regeneration air inlet valve (2-Fig. 1.5)  fully. Open dryer air outlet valve (10-Fig. 1.5) \nand close by-pass valve (9-Fig. 1.5). \n20. Open valve (3-Fig. 3.2a) marked (-) of the U- tube.  Slightly open valve (1-Fig. 3.2a) marked \n(+), while watching the water levels in the U-tube.  Two conditions are possible: \n- The water level in the leg marked (+) rises.  Close valve (1-Fig. 3.2a) at once, decrease \nthe regeneration air inlet pressure (see step 21).  Do this as often as necessary, until the \nwater level drops. \n- The water level in the leg marked (-) rises, which should normally be the case.  If the level \nin this leg rises 30 mm  above the level in the leg marked (+ ), close valve (1-Fig. 3.2a) at \nonce, as there is a risk that the water will be ejected from the U-tube and disappear into \nthe pressure vessel. \n Increase the regeneration air inlet pressure (see step 21) and open valve (1-Fig. 3.2a) \nagain. \n21. Once the water column has stabilized, adjust the pressure differential as follows: \n Remove the protecting cap form the adjusti ng screw (4-Fig. 3.2a), loosen its check nut and \nturn the screw in to increase or out to decreas e the pressure differential. Tighten the check nut \nand reinstall the protection cap. \n \n The average difference between both legs must be 8 ± 3 mm. (Fig. 3.2b)  The level in the leg \nmarked (-) must always be above the level in the leg marked (+).  In case of fluctuating water \nlevels, the average difference can be set at a maximum of 11 mm to keep the level in the leg \nmarked (-) at any time above the level in the leg marked (+).  When the average difference is \nset at 11 mm and the level in the leg marked (-) d oes not stay at any time above the level in \nthe leg marked (+), consult Atlas Copco. \n \n22. Check the dryer connections for air leaks. \n23. Check that the moisture indicator shows blue after approximately 30 minutes of operation.  \n24. On ZR compressors with IMD dryer:  adjust the valve (5-Fig. 3.7) until the air inlet \ntemperature of the high pressure element is at least 25°C and maximum 30°C higher than the \nwater inlet temperature.

Care\nshall be taken to minimize the entry of moisture with the inlet air.\n4. The aspirated air shall be free from flammable fumes or vapours,\ne.g. paint solvents, that can lead to internal fire or explosion.\n5. Air -cooled units shall be installed in such a way that an adequate\nflow of cooling air is available and that the exhausted air does not\nrecirculate to the inlet.\n6. Arrange the air intake so that loose clothing of people cannot be\nsucked in.\n7. Ensure that the dischar ge pipe from the compressor to the aftercooler,\nair dryer or air net is free to expand under heat and that it is not in\ncontact with or close to flammable material.\n8. No external force may be exerted on the air outlet valve; the connected\npipe must be free of strain.\n9. If remote control is installed, the unit shall bear an obvious sign\nreading:\nDANGER: This machine is r emotely contr olled and may start\nwithout warning.\nAs a further safeguard, persons switching on remotely controlled\nunits shall take adequate precautions to ensure that there is no onechecking or working on the machine.  To this end, a suitable notice\nshall be af fixed to the start equipment.\n10. On units with automatic start-stop system, a sign stating \"This\nmachine may start without warning\" shall be attached near the\ninstrument panel.\n11. In multiple compressor systems manual valves shall be installed to\nisolate each compressor.  Non-return valves (check valves) shall not\nbe relied upon for isolating pressure systems.\n12. Never remove or tamper with the safety devices, guards or insulations\nfitted on the unit.  Every pressure vessel or auxiliary installed outside\nthe unit to contain air above atmospheric pressure shall be protectedby a pressure-relieving device or devices as required.\n13.

The\nunits shall be grounded and protected against short circuits by fuses.\nOperation\n1. Air hoses shall be of correct size and suitable for the working pressure.\nNever use frayed, damaged or deteriorated hoses.  Use only the correct\ntype and size of hose end fittings and connections.  When blowing\nthrough a hose or air line, ensure that the open end is held securely.\nA  free end will whip and may cause injury. Make sure that a hose is\nfully depressurized before disconnecting it.\nNever play with compressed air.  Do not apply it to your skin or\ndirect an air stream at people.  Never use it to clean dirt from your\nclothes.  When using it to clean equipment, do so with extreme caution\nand use eye protection.\n2. The compressor is not considered as capable of producing air of\nbreathing quality.  For breathing air quality, the compressed air must\nbe adequately purified according to local legislation and standards.\n3. Never operate the units when there is a possibility of taking in\nflammable or toxic fumes.\n4. Never operate the units at pressures below or in excess of their limit\nratings as indicated on the Principal Data sheet.\n5. Keep all bodywork doors shut during operation.  The doors may be\nopened for short periods only, e.g. to carry out checks.  W ear ear\nprotectors when opening a door.\n6. People staying in environments or rooms where the sound pressure\nlevel reaches or exceeds 90 dB(A) shall wear ear protectors.\n7. Periodically check that:\na. All guards are in place and securely fastened\nb. All hoses and/or pipes inside the unit are in good condition, secure\nand not rubbing\nc. There are no leaks\nd. All fasteners are tight\ne. All electrical leads are secure and in good order\nf. Safety valves and other pressure-relief devices are not obstructed\nby dirt or paint\ng. Air outlet valve and air net, i.e. pipes, couplings, manifolds,\nvalves, hoses, etc. are in good repair, free of wear or abuse\n8. If warm cooling air from compressors is used in air heating systems,\ne.g. to warm up a workroom, take precautions against air pollutionand possible contamination of the breathing air.\n9. Do not remove any of, or tamper with, the sound-damping material.\nMaintenance\nMaintenance and repair work shall only be carried out under supervision\nof someone qualified for the job.\n1. Use only the correct tools for maintenance and repair work.\n2. Use only genuine spare parts.\n3. All maintenance work, other than routine attention, shall only be\nundertaken when the unit is stopped, the main power supply is\nswitched off and the machine has cooled down.  T ake positive\nprecaution to ensure that the unit cannot be started inadvertently.\nIn addition, a warning sign bearing a legend such as \"work in\npr ogress; do not star t \"  shall be attached to the starting equipment.\n4. Before removing any pressurized component, ef fectively isolate the\nunit from all sources of pressure and relieve the entire system of\npressure.5. Never use flammable solvents or carbon tetrachloride for cleaning\nparts.  Take safety precautions against toxic vapours of cleaning\nliquids.\n6. Scrupulously observe cleanliness during maintenance and repair.\nKeep dirt away by covering the parts and exposed openings with a\nclean cloth, paper or tape.\n7. Never weld or perform any operation involving heat near the oil\nsystem.  Oil tanks must be completely purged, e.g. by steam-cleaning,\nbefore carrying out such operations.\nNever weld on, or in any way modify, pressure vessels.\nWhenever there is an indication or any suspicion that an internal\npart of a machine is overheated, the machine shall be stopped but no\ninspection covers shall be opened before suf ficient cooling time\nhas elapsed; this to avoid the risk of spontaneous ignition of the oil\nvapour when air is admitted.\nNever use a light source with open flame for inspecting the interior\nof a machine, pressure vessel, etc.\n8. Make sure that no tools, loose parts or rags are left in or on the unit.\n9. Before clearing the unit for use after maintenance or overhaul, check\nthat operating pressures, temperatures and time settings are correct\nand that the control and shut-down devices function correctly.   If\nremoved, check that the coupling guard of the compressor drive shaft\nhas been reinstalled.\n10. Every time the separator element is renewed, examine the discharge\npipe and the inside of the oil separator vessel for carbon deposits; if\nexcessive, the deposits should be removed.\n11. Protect the motor,  air filter, electrical and regulating components,\netc. to prevent moisture from entering them, e.g. when steam-cleaning.\n12. Make sure that all sound-damping material, e.g. on the bodywork\nand in the air inlet and outlet systems of the compressor, is in good\ncondition.  If damaged, replace it by genuine Atlas Copco material\nto prevent the sound pressure level from increasing.\n13. Never use caustic solvents which can damage materials of the air\nnet, e.g. polycarbonate bowls.\n14. The following safety precautions are stressed when handling\nrefrigerant:\na. Never inhale refrigerant vapours.  Check that the working area\nis adequately ventilated; if required, use breathing protection.\nb. Always wear special gloves.  In case of refrigerant contact with\nthe skin, rinse the skin with water.  If liquid refrigerant contacts\nthe skin through clothing, never tear off or remove the latter;\nflush abundantly with fresh water over the clothing until all\nrefrigerant is flushed away; then seek medical first aid.\nc. Always wear safety glasses.\n15. Protect hands to avoid injury from hot machine parts, e.g. during\ndraining of oil.\nNote: W ith stationary machine units driven by an internal combustion\nengine, allowance has to be made for extra safety precautions, e.g. spark\narrestors, fuelling care, etc.  Consult Atlas Copco.\nAll responsibility for any damage or injur y resulting fr om neglecting\nthese precautions, or by non-observance of ordinary caution and due\ncare required in handling, operating, maintenance or repair,  even if\nnot expr essly mentioned in this book, will be disclaimed by Atlas\nCopco.SAFETY PRECA UTIONS (continued)\n2920 1377 03                2 /2"

CAUTION!      WARNING!\n        DANGER!\nQuantum Identification\nFrick Controls has over the years, strived to remain on the\ncutting edge of microprocessor technology anddevelopment. And because of the ever-increasing speed,\nmemory, features and power of microprocessors, Frick\nControls will, from time to time, introduce the latestadvancement in microprocessor control technology.\nOur microprocessor family has shared the name\nQuantum,  over the past five years. There are currently\nfour controllers within this family. The first two of these\ncontrollers (known as Quantum 1 and Quantum 2) are nolonger in production, and as such, will not be further\nmentioned in this manual. The two current members in\nproduction of the Quantum family are the Quantum 3, andthe Quantum 4. It is critical to the end user to be able to\nidentify the differences between these controllers. Refer to\nthe section in this manual entitled \"Quantum 3 Main BoardHistory and Identification\" and \"Quantum 4 Main Board\nHistory and Identification\" for additional information as to\nhow to identify the particular Quantum controller that youhave.\nThroughout this manual, the two different controllers willbe talked about for the most part as one (as they dofunction the same). Where there is a difference between\nthese boards, as in jumpers or wiring, the different models\nwill be identified by name. This is why it is important foryou to be aware of which Quantum board you have.\nQuantum 3\nQuantum 4TROUBLESHOOTING\nTHE QUANTUM CONTROL PANEL\nThis section contains information on troubleshooting andmaking corrections to the boards and control circuits of theQuantum. Reference the drawings at the end of this\nmanual.\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\nThe components within the control panel can be\ninadvertently damaged by static electricity or\nmishandling. Only qualified technicians shoulddirectly handle these components.\n1. DO NOT attempt to make corrections to the power\nsupply without shutting off the power to the control\npanel. Accidental shorts can irreparably damage\nthe processor boards or the display screen.\n2. DO NOT HANDLE the panel boards when their\ncables are disconnected without first attaching aproperly grounded wrist ground strap to prevent\nstatic electrical discharge from your body.\nMost problems encountered with the microprocessor andcontrol circuits will be the result of a wiring fault, a blownfuse, faulty I/O module or failure of a peripheral controlsuch as a solenoid coil or a pressure transducer. Faults in\nthe computer, while possible, are unlikely. If a fault\ndevelops in the computer, the probability is that allfunctions will cease and the display screen will go blank.\nThe control system of the compressor consists of an AC\n(high voltage) side, which can be either 120 volts, or 230volts, and a DC (low voltage) side. The AC side actuates\nsolenoids, relays, alarms, and other electromechanical\nfunctions. The DC side operates the computer and it'svarious sensors.\nWhen working within the panel, the AC high voltage\nside, which can be either nominal 120 VAC or nominal230 VAC, CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH.\nTo troubleshoot the low-voltage side of the control circuits,\nit is necessary to have the following tools:\n1. Accurate digital multimeter*\n2. Small wire stripper\n3. Small screwdriver\n4. Small snip nose pliers\n5. Wrist Grounding strap*\n6. Static free grounded work surface\nNote: Proper panel voltage refers to the AC (high volt-\nage) that has been supplied to the panel which could\nbe either nominal 120 VAC or nominal 230 VAC(Reference the Control Panel Power Specifications).\nSome problems that are encountered involve\ntroubleshooting the panels digital inputs and outputs. The\nDigital I/O (Input/Output) boards have six Digital I/O (DIO)\nboard connectors labeled P1 through P6. The input andoutput modules are wired into a DIO connector plug.\nPosition 3 pro-vides power and position 4 is a neutral on\nthe DIO connectors.FRICK QUANTUM COMPRESSOR CONTROL PANEL                                       S90-010  M\n                                                            MAINTENANCE                                                                           Page  5\n\nS90-010  M                                        FRICK QUANTUM COMPRESSOR CONTROL PANEL\nPage 6                                                                            MAINTENANCE\nWHAT TO DO BEFORE CALLING THE FACTORY\n/g183 The “Operating Status” screen is shown.\nWhen someone calls in to the factory with a Quantum\nproblem, they usually don’t provide enough information.\nAn example of this is the statement that the Quantum is\nnot “booting” (the main processor board is not starting).Unfortunately, this description is usually vague and only\nmeans that there is nothing on the display. A blank screen\ncould be the result of many different problems. Followingis a list of possible reasons for no display:\n/g183 No power\n/g183 Loose or Faulty Display Cable or Inverter Cable\n/g183 Bad Display\n/g183 Bad Backlight Inverter\n/g183 Bad Backlight Fluorescent Tube\n/g183 Faulty CPU Board\n/g183 Wrong Combination of Display, Cable, Inverter,\nor Software\nBefore calling the factory for assistance, review the\nfollowing information and try to discover and resolve your\nQuantum problem.\nWHAT SHOULD OCCUR WHEN POWERING UP\nTHE PANEL\nThe first thing that should be checked when\ntroubleshooting the Quantum is it’s powering up\nsequence.\nWhen powering up the Quantum the following sequence of\nevents are indicative of a properly working main processor\nboard:\nQuantum 3\n/g183 The LED’s for +5V, +12V, and –12V will turn\non solid. (Lower left corner of Main PCB)\n/g183 LED KB will begin to blink. (Left side of Main\nPCB)\n/g183 Several initialization screens will appear(these will look very similar to the way the\nscreen of a desktop computer appears whenit is booting.\n/g183 The last of the initialization screens is the\n“System Configuration” screen.\n/g183 The screen will go blank for several seconds.\n/g183 The “Operating Status” screen is shown.\nAfter the Quantum has properly powered up, the\nfollowing sequence of events is indicative ofproper communication to the analog and digital\nboards:\n/g183 The TX/RX LED’s  near the white connectorwill begin to blink.\n/g183 The Analog and Digital I/O boards TX/RXlights should be blinking.\n/g183 Each I/O board should have the power LED(next to the white connector) lighted and the“Active” LED (next to the blue DIP switch)\nshould be blinking.Quantum 4\n/g183 Green PWR (Power) LED will turn on solid\n(upper right corner of main PCB).\n/g183 Red FLASH LED will begin to intermittently\nduring the Boot process. It will then go out\nonce the \"Operating Status\" screen appears.\n/g183 LED D8 (on the smaller board) will start to\nblink at the rate of about once per second. Itwill continue to blink after the Quantum has\nbooted.\n/g183 Once the screen displays \"Loading…\", LED's\nD4 , D5, D7 and D8 will be on solid. \n/g183 The \"Operating Status\" screen will appear.\n/g183 Once actual data has been displayed on thisscreen, LED D13 will come on solid andD10, D11, and D12 will start to flash at a\nquick rate.\nAfter the Quantum has properly powered up, thefollowing sequence of events is indicative ofproper communication to the analog and digital\nboards:\n/g183 The TX/RX LED’s  near the white connector\nwill begin to blink.\n/g183 The Analog and Digital I/O boards TX/RX\nlights should be blinking.\n/g183 Each I/O board should have the power LED(next to the white connector) lighted and the\n“Active” LED (next to the blue DIP switch)\nshould be blinking.\nWHAT IF THE “OPERATING STATUS” SCREEN\nIS NOT SHOWN\nIf the “Operating Status” screen is not shown, check the\nfollowing items:\nQuantum 3\n1. If no LED’s are lighted, then check power AC\nand DC. \n2. Check if the lighting of the LED’s is occurring\nas de-scribed in the “What Should Occur\nWhen Powering Up The Panel” section.\n/g183 If the powering up sequence continuesto repeat without displaying the\n“Operating Status” screen, then there is\na booting problem.\n3. Check if an error message is displayed when\nbooting.\n/g183 Be sure to write down any error\nmessages that appear.\n4. Check that the software is OK:\n/g183 Is the correct software installed?\n/g183 Did you just install new software?\n/g183 If you need to clear the numerical\nsetpoint and calibration areas of\nmemory for any reason, clear the\nmemory as described in the S90-010\nFSI publication .

Itmay be necessary to remove the video\ncable from the back of the LCD displayand reseat it to be sure it is connected\nproperly. Note: This is a small\nconnector and caution should beobserved so that it is not damaged\ndue to excessive force.\n/g183 Check the backlight inverter connector\n(P4). When the Quantum board ismounted in the panel, this connector is\nlocated at the middle left of the board.The pins on the right side are odd\nnumbered, with pin P(1) at the bottom -\npin P(9) at the top. The pins on the leftside are even numbered, with pin P(2)\nat the bottom - pin P(10) at the top. After\nthe Quantum has booted, pin P(3)should measure +2.4Vdc, pins P(4) and\nP(5) are DC grounds, and pins P(6) and\nP(7) should measure +12Vdc. A badinverter will also cause a dark display. \n/g183 Reference the \"Display Assembly\nComponent Replacement Guide\" at the\nend of this section and check that theLCD, LCD cable, and software versions\nare matched correctly.Quantum 4\n1.

If a board has lost\ncommunications, a shutdown will be issued. All outputsare turned off on a Digital Board that has lost\ncommunications. All outputs will get set to their minimum\nvalue range on an Analog Board that has lostcommunications. A loss of communications to an analog\nboard will probably result in sensor fault shutdown\nmessages that are associated with the sensors on thatboard.\nDiagnosing an Analog or Digital Board Problem\nThe Analog and Digital Boards have built-in features thathelp to troubleshoot faulty boards. Following is adescription of the built-in features:\n1. The Analog and Digital Boards have an “Active “\nLED indicator on the board that blinks when the\nboard’s software is running.\n/g183 If the “Active” LED is not blinking, check to\nensure that the EPROM is installed properly.\n2. There is also a “Power” LED that lights when DC\npower is applied to the board.\n/g183 If the power LED is not lighted, check the\ncable for proper connectivity. Note: Eachboard provides the necessary\nconnections to feed all signals to the\nfollowing connectors. If the auxiliaryAnalog or Digital Board is not presentthen a jumper plug (Part # 640B0039H01)\nmust be installed to daisy chain the\nsignals.\n3. The main indication of communications is the\nRX/TX LED’s on the I/O board. These LED’sshould blink in response to the blinking of the\nmain processor board’s I/O communication\nactivity RX/TX LED’s. If the RX LED on the I/Oboard is blinking but the board was not detected\non the “About” screen, or an I/O Comm failure\noccurs, check the address of the board. \n/g183 Reference the \"JUMPER AND DIPSWITCH\nSETTINGS\" section later in this manual. This\nsection contains the dipswitch settings for\naddressing the Analog and Digital I/O\nBoards numbers (1) through (6). When theseswitches are properly set, the main\nprocessor board is able to serially\ncommunicate with each board and providecontrol signals and data exchange.\nS90-010  M                                        FRICK QUANTUM COMPRESSOR CONTROL PANEL\nPage 10                                                                            MAINTENANCE\n\"Service Screen\" - Digital Board Inputs and Outputs\nTroubleshooting Digital Inputs and Outputs\nThe “Service Screen” has been provided to view the raw\ndata from a Digital Board.

The DigitalI/O (Input / Output) boards have six Digital I/O (DIO) board\nconnectors labeled P1 through P6. The input and output\nmodules are wired to a DIO connector plug. Position 3provides power and position 4 is a neutral on the DIO\nconnectors. Position 1, 2, 5, and 6 are signal connections.\nThe Digital I/O board’s I/O modules are configured by\nproper module selection, AC or DC, operating voltage,\ninput or output, and moving the fuse to the “in” or “out”\nposition. An LED is associated with each module anddisplays the state of each module. A lighted LED\nrepresents an Input that is “High” or an Output that is “On”.\nEach of the sixteen modules has a corresponding softwareconfiguration screen. \nIf a properly configured Digital I/O is not responding\ncorrectly, first look at the digital board on the “Service\nScreen” and check if the module is on. If it is not on, checkif the LED on the digital board is also not lit. If the LED is\nnot lit, then check the fuse. If the fuse is OK, then check\nthe module.\nFUSE TESTING AND REPLACEMENT\n1.

There is a separate screen for\neach of the Analog Boards that are present. Analog valuesare converted from binary to show volts. The error factor is\n/g177 .05 volts.\nChecking The Analog Inputs and Outputs\nThe Analog I/O Boards have numerous jumpers that must\nbe properly selected. There are sixteen analog input\nchannels that can be selected for 4-20ma, 0-5Vdc, orICTD. Channel #16 will also take the 0-5 Amp motor CT\nas an input. All of these jumper settings are listed later in\nthis manual (Jumper and Dipswitch Settings Section).Besides properly setting the hardware jumpers, each\nchannel is setup in software for the proper transducer type\nand range, and each transducer must also be calibratedthrough the appropriate sensor calibration screen.\nImproper setup of either the hardware or software will\nresult in improper operation or range. The most common fault associated with the reading of theanalog channels other than hardware or software setup\nproblems fall into one of the following categories: Sensor\nfault, wiring problem, improper grounding of system. \nAn open wire, shorted wire, or faulty sensor will usuallygive a reading at either the minimum or maximum end of\nthe range scale. An erratic reading or a reading that\nseems to float up and down is usually indicative of agrounding problem. When a single transducer or cable is\nshorted to earth (or system) gr ound, this can show up as a\nwhole assortment of problem channels. The easiest way\nto find a short to earth problem is to disconnect all the\nsensor plugs and ohm out each plug screw terminal to\nearth for open (infinite) impedance. All sensors shouldread open to earth with the exception of the CT motor\ncurrent channel. One side of the CT is grounded in the\nMotor Control Center (MCC). (The third pin on pressuresensors is ground.) \nS90-010  M                                        FRICK QUANTUM COMPRESSOR CONTROL PANEL\nPage 12                                                                            MAINTENANCE\nADDING AND REPLACING BOARDS\nQUANTUM\nReplacing the Main Board involves a Flash Card memory\nload which will clear the current setpoints and data stored\nin the non-volatile memory on the main board.

It is important to know if the unit ever worked\nproperly.\n2. If the unit used to work properly, try to determine\nwhen the problem first showed up.\n3. It is important to know if the problem occurs\nrandomly, frequently, or all the time.\n4. Check what the temperature is in the engine\nroom and at the panel. Is it very hot or very cold?\n/g183 Make sure that the motor is not blowing\nexhaust air on the control panel.\n5. If it just started to act up, then check if there was\nrecently a severe lightning storm, fire, flood, or aplant accident. If any of the following conditions\nare possible, then check for it:\n/g183 Has any water, refrigerant, or oil leaked into\nthe panel or conduit?\n/g183 Is the conduit with the Slide Valve or SlideStop full of liquid?\n/g183 Is the Slide Stop potentiometer cover filled\nwith water?\n6. If it just started to act up, then check if anything\nwas recently changed in the system (i.e. software\nor hardware.)\n7. If it just started to act up, then check if any\nservice was recently done to the compressor or\nit’s electrical system?\n8. If there is communication wiring connecting the\npanel to another panel or device, then check the\nfollowing:\n/g183 If the Quantum is unexplainably shutting\ndown, try disconnecting the communications\ncable to see if the problem goes away.\n/g183 Check if the communications cable shields\nare tied to machine ground at only one\nlocation. For a PLC or Opto22 based\nsystem, the shield should normally be tied\nonly at the PLC or Opto22 panel. For dualsequencing machines, the shield should only\nbe tied to ground in one panel, typically the\n“Lead” machine. \n/g183 Check that you are using the Frick\nrecommended communications cable. See\nmanual to match proper cable with type of\ncommunications (i.e., RS-422, RS-232, RS-\n485, or some other type of factory\ncommunication bus system.)\n9. If this is an older plant, has the plant wiring beenbrought up to code?\n10. Do you have power wiring mixed with controlwiring?\n11. Do you have power wiring mixed with sensor\nwiring?\n12. Do you have power wiring mixed with\ncommunications wiring?\n13. Check that the starter panel is grounded to the\nplant transformer. There are usually four wires: 3\nfor the 3 phases and 1 for plant ground.14. Check that the motor is grounded to the starter\npanel. There are usually four wires: 3 for the\nphases and 1 for ground.\n15. Ensure that one side of the motor currenttransformer is grounded in the motor starter\npanel. The wire to the control panel terminal #2 is\nusually the only one grounded. \n16. Check that the pressure transducers are properly\ngrounded. The two types of transducers you may\nhave are as follows: an older type has an 8 to 10inch 3-conductor pigtail coming out of the\ntransducer. This type will have the attaching\ncable’s shield cut off and insulated at thetransducer end. The shield is then tied to a panelground terminal in the panel. The newer type has\nthe cable as an integral part of the housing and\nhas the shield crimped to the case at thetransducer end. This type of transducer has the\ncable’s shield cut off and insulated in the control\npanel.\n17. Check that the temperature transducers are\nproperly grounded. The temperature probes\nusually have two short wires coming out of thesensor, and are tied to a shielded cable at the\nthermal well head. The shield is grounded at the\ntemperature probe and insulated at the panelend.\n18. Check if one of the temperature probes has a\nsignal wire shorted to machine ground. To do\nthis, first pull the orange plug from the microboard and then use an Ohmmeter and check\neach white wire to machine ground and each\nblack wire to machine ground.\n19. Check that all inductive loads (i.e. Coils,\nSolenoids, or Relays, etc.) connected to the I/O\noutput modules have surge suppressers acrossthem, preferably at the devices and not at the\npanel end.\n20. If the compressor control settings unexplainably\nchange modes, it may be a noise problemaffecting the keypad’s input circuit. Check if it\nworks OK with the keypad cable disconnected. If\nit works OK, then check the grounding asdescribed above. If the grounding is OK then\nreplace the keypad.\n21. Make sure that you have a continuous ground\nback to the power source. The ground connection\nmust be aluminum or copper. A conduit ground\nwill not work. Do not drive a ground stake at thecompressor since extraneous currents will be\nattracted to the compressor.\n22. Make sure that there is no AC wiring lying next to\nthe printed circuit board.\n23. Unexplainable compressor auxiliary failures are\nusually indicative of noise due to wiring problems\n(i.e. incorrect earth grounds, mixed power andcontrol wiring, unsuppressed coils, etc)\n24. If the compressor is unexplainably shutting down,\ncheck if the machine shares control transformer\npower with something else. Make sure eachcompressor has its own isolation transformer in\nthe motor control center off of the three-phase\nbus with the secondary properly grounded.\nTROUBLESHOOTING CHART FOR FRICK QUANTUM CONTROL PANEL\n(REFER TO WIRING DIAGRAMS)\nSYMPTOM PROBABLE CAUSES and CORRECTIONS\nDISPLAY IS INOPERATIVE Check for power at the panel. See if any of the diagnostic lamps on the Main\nBoard are blinking or any lights are blinking on the other boards. If no lightsare blinking, make sure the control power switch is switched on. If there arestill no lights, then check the circuit breaker (2CB). If the breaker is not tripped,\ncheck for power into 2CB. If there is no power, check the external power being\nsupplied. If power from 2CB, check power supply for input AC and output DClevel.\nShut off power to the panel and first confirm that connector CN2 is connected\n(on back of display). This is a delicate connection and care should be used to\nreconnect it. Confirm that CN1 and CN2 of the backlight inverter areconnected.

COMPRESSOR / COMPRESSED AIR SAFETY  \n \nMEA DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITIES FOR DAMAGE OR LOSS OF EQUIPMENT AND PROPERTY, \nPERSONAL INJURIES (INCLUDING DEATH), AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF \nANY MEA SYSTEM NOT USED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPERATOR’S MANUAL.  \nALL UNITS ARE SHIPPED WITH A DETAILED OPERATOR’S MANUAL. THIS MANUAL CONTAINS \nVITAL INFORMATION FOR THE SAFE USE AND EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THE UNIT. READ THE \nOPERATOR’S MANUAL BEFORE STARTING THE UNIT. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THE \nINSTRUCTIONS COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS BODILY HARM OR PROPE RTY DAMAGE.  \nCare is required when working with an air compressor or compressed air. Compressed air is one of the many \nways energy can be stored. Releasing the stored energy in an uncontrolled manner can result in catastrophic \nconsequences. Death and perman ent disability are possibilities that can occur due to misuse . The following \nare suggested as minimum precautions to be used when operating the SMARTPACK Air Compressor. It is \nimportant that each work site shall perform a risk analysis and produce a proced ure to eliminate or control \nthe hazardous condition to minimise the risk to personnel and equipment. Health and Safety Regulations \nnecessitate that this is a compulsory process to be carried out on each site. These, together with site specific \nsafety proce dures will help to minimize the risk to accidents, personnel injury,  and loss of life. It is the \nresponsibility of the employer to ensure that the work site is safe for all employees and that the safety \nprocedures are followed by all employees.  \n \nSAFETY WHEN OPERATING AN AIR COMPRESSOR  \n \n• Do not bypass or disable the oil temperature and pressure sensors – unless planning on running to \nfailure (MEA does not recommend the practice).  \n• Do not expose the tank or compressor to extreme heat.  \n• Do not perform  any service or repairs until the system has been completely relieved of air pressure.  \n• Maintenance and repairs on the system should only be done by qualified personnel.  \n• Do not operate the compressor while driving (vehicle mounted systems).  \n• Do not tamper wi th the pressure relief valve.  \n• Follow safe work practice, wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when operating \nair-powered equipment, particularly eye and hearing protection.  \n• Avoid contact with rotating components, ensure all safety guard s are in place.  \n• Avoid all contact with pressurized air. If it penetrates the skin, it can enter blood stream and cause \ndeath.  \n• Vaporized oil propelled by high pressure is an explosive mixture. To prevent compressor explosion \nor fire, make sure that the air entering the compressor is free of flammable vapours . \n• Do not breathe the compressor air, vaporized oil is a respiratory hazard.  \n• Stay clear of all moving parts when the system is operating.  \n• Follow safety procedures for service operations as set by the authority.  \n• Run the system at idle speed and under no load conditions for 2 to 3 minutes before turning the \nsystem off to allow system cooling and lubrication to occur.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDocument No 7231 -D0001 -03   \nMobile Energy Australia Pty Ltd  39 Dulacca Street, Acacia Ridge QLD 4110 Australia   ABN 98 674 578 946  \nP: +61 7 3273 6803   E: sales@mobilenergyaustralia.com.au  www.mobileenergyaustralia.com.au  \n \n \nHYDRAULIC SAFETY  \n \nALL HYDRAULIC EQUIPMENT MUST BE TREATED WITH EXTREME \nRESPECT AND CARE. AS THE WORKING FLUID IS UNDER EXTREME \nPRESSURE, UP TO 5000PSI, WITH HIGH FLOW RATES GENERATING \nHIGH HEAT, ALL APPROPRIATE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS MUST BE \nTAKEN IN TO ACCOUNT AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT MUST BE WORN IF \nIN CONTACT WITH THE EQUIPMENT UN DER OPERATION. ALL LEAKS, \nNO MATTER HOW MINOR, MUST BE RECTIFIED IMMEDIATELY AND \nANY WEAR IN THE HOSES MUST BE ADDRESSED AND EQUIPMENT \nREPLACED.

INSTALLATION  \n \nThe SMARTPACK 100H  is designed as an integrated compressor system for connection to an existing hydraulic \nsystem.  The SMARTPACK 100H  only requires conne ction of a pressure line in, a return line out and a \nconnection of the motor drain line (if applicable)  to the tank. \n \nWARNING(!) W hen setting the comp ressor unit up, ensure there is a safety mechanism in place to \nprevent any excessive flow or pressure into the compressor hydraulic ci rcuit.  MEA will not warrant \nany damage caused and will void warranty  due to  inadequate safety protection of the existing \nhydraulic system. \n \n1. Install SMARTPACK 100H i nto position on the vehicle using 4 x min. M12 x 1.75 Grade 8.8 Fasteners. \n \n2. Install the hydraulic lines (i.e., pressure in, return out and drain line if applicable) . The pressure line \n(hydraulic oil inlet) goes to the fitting with label “P”. The return line (hydraulic oil out) goes to the fitting \nwith label “T”.  \n \n3. Conne ct the electrical harness as per the circuit diagram relevant to your vehicle. \n \n4. Check the oil level in  the compressor. \n \n5. Switch on the vehicle, turn on the compressor at the control box and test the hydraulic solenoid for \noperation. \n \n6. Turn the unload/load switch to load and check the compressor builds pressure to the regulated \npressure setting. \n \n7. Plug an air tool into the air outlet and operate checking that the compressor works as required, run for \n10mins. Stop using air, let the compressor reach full pressure, then leave the vehicle idling for 2 to 3 \nminutes before switching off.  \n \n8. Switch off the vehicle and check for any visible signs of hydraulic fluid leakage.  \n \n9. When the compressor has cooled down (safe to touch), re -check the compressor oil level.  \n \nENSURE THAT A WATER SEPARATOR IS MOUNTED AS FAR FROM THE COMPRESSOR \nAS POSSIBLE OR THAT IT HAS AT LEAST TWO METRES OF HOSING BETWEEN THE \nCOMPRESSOR DISCHARGE AND SEP ARATOR INLET . \n \n \n \n \n \nDocument No 7231 -D0001 -03   \nMobile Energy Australia Pty Ltd  39 Dulacca Street, Acacia Ridge QLD 4110 Australia   ABN 98 674 578 946  \nP: +61 7 3273 6803   E: sales@mobilenergyaustralia.com.au  www.mobileenergyaustralia.com.au  \n5. SCHEDULE MAINTENANCE  \n \nThe maintenance intervals recommended are based on standard operating conditions. T he \nintervals for inspection, lubrication and maintenance  given herein  are maximum intervals  and \nit should be noted to schedule the maintenance accordingly to sites.   \n \nWhen the unit is being operated  in a dusty environment, in high ambient temperatures or in \nother unusual conditions , an assessment needs to be done for shorter service interval.   \nA planned program of periodic inspection and maintenance will help to avoid premature \nfailure and costly repairs.

Operation Control Mode Setting\n    It is possible to change between Multi-Drive control mode and pressure switch control mode.\n   The operation of the air compressor can be controlled as followed.\n(1) Multi-Drive Control Mode (Energy Saving mode)    Responding to the need of compressed air, the operation of SRL compressor heads is modified\n    automatically to keep the delivery pressure at around the necessary pressure (recovery pressure). This\n    operation allows the compressor to save energy by avoiding useless operation of compressor heads.\n(2) Pressure Switch Control Mode    The operation of SRL compressor heads is controlled by Pressure Switch Control Mode. The operation\n    of all SRL compressor heads are stopped simultaneously when the unit stops operating.\n    When starting the unit, the operation of each SRL compressor head starts one after another in\n    approximately 1.5 second increments to reduce the starting load.Operation (continued)\n14 2  Prior to Operation\nHow to select the control mode\nPress the \"Control Mode Switch\" when the main power in ON and while the air compressor is not \nrunning.

The indication on the \ndigital display changes to H122 (this is an example of what the indication on the digital \ndisplay will be for the pressure settings from the factory).\n4Pressing the stop switch will lower the maximum pressure setting by 1 PSIG. \nPressing the start switch will raise the maximum pressure setting by 1 PSIG.\n5After the change in pressure setting has been set, press the Screen Shift switch \nand the digital display indication will change to PC.\n6Pressing the Screen Shift switch again will change the digital display indication to the \npressure display.\nTo change the recovery (start) pressure, press the stop switch in steps 3 above to change \nthe digital display indication to L110 (this is an example of what the indication on the digital display will be for the pressure settings from the factory) and then change the pressure \nsettings as shown in steps 4 and later.  \n■ Cycle Control Logic (CCL): Operation and protection from excessive cycling of the main motors\n● The SRL air compressor measures the \"ON-OFF cycle number\" after the pressure settings have been\n    changed and automatically adjusts the maximum (stop) pressure to prevent the \"ON-OFF cycle\" from\n    increasing when the \"ON-OFF cycle number\" increases exponentially, thus protecting the scroll head,    electric motor and electromagnetic contactor (Please see the figure below).\n● After the CCL adjusts the maximum (stop) pressure, the CCL continues to automatically measure the\n   \"ON-OFF cycle number\" and lower the maximum (stop) pressure within the permissible range of the   \"ON-OFF cycle number\", until the CCL nears the set maximum (stop) pressure of the air compressor\n    and the \"ON-OFF cycle number\" becomes consistent. \n● A protection device is equipped on this unit to prevent frequent ON-OFF operations. Start Frequency\n    Protection automatically measures cycles of ON-OFF, and in the case that the cycle of ON-OFF is less\n    than 20 seconds, the operation will continued for 20 seconds even if the maximum pressure setting is\n    lowered. In the event that it takes less than 20 seconds to reach the standard maximum pressure\n   (122psig/145psig) the controller will stop the operation of the air compressor at 122psig/145psig.    If this happens 5 times continuously, it is defined as a「ON-OFF cycle error」. If this occurs「E.CY」\n    will be indicated on the digital display, and the operation of the air compressor will stop to protect the\n    compressor head, electric motors and electromagnetic contactor.\n● Pressing the Stop switch will reset the unit from the「ON-OFF cycle error」, and allow it to restart the\n    operation of the air compressor. However, if the situation which caused the「ON-OFF cycle error」  is\n    not eliminated, the「ON-OFF cycle error」  will occur again.\n● To lower the amount of cycles of ON-OFF the recovery pressure will need to be lowered by following\n    the procedure for changing the control pressure setting. (Refer to P.15)\n    If the recovery pressure is already set at its lowest point, a larger air receiver will need to be installed.\n16Operation (continued)\n■ Changeable Pressure Ranges\n122 PSIG Model\nPressure\nDescriptionMaximum (Stop)\nPressure (psig)Recovery (Start)\nPressure (psig)Pressure\nBandwidth (psig)Pressure Unit \nInterval of Change \nStandard Pressure 122 110 12 -\nChangeable\nPressure Range122 - 92 110 - 80 12 1\n145 PSIG Model\nPressure\nDescriptionMaximum (Stop)\nPressure (psig)Recovery (Start)\nPressure (psig)Pressure\nBandwidth (psig)Pressure Unit \nInterval of Change \nStandard Pressure 145 115 30 -\nChangeable\nPressure Range145 - 95 130 - 80 15 1\nNotes:  1.

Make sure to press the Stop switch before turning    off the main power supply when conducting maintenance. ● In the case of a power failure, turn off the main power supply. Be aware that residual pressure may\n    exist even though there is not a digital display. ● When restarting the operation of the air compressor turn on the main power supply and verify the    operation control mode before pressing the Start switch.WARNING\n   Digital Display    Start  Switch    Stop  Switch\nSteps Digital Display\n1Verify if the pressure is indicated on the digital display.\n2Press the stop switch continuously for three seconds.\n \"P-0\" is indicated on the digital display.\n3Press the start switch until \"P-1\" is indicated on the digital dispiay and \npower failure automatic recovery is set.\n4To cancel the power failure automatic recovery, carry out steps 1 to 3 \nto indicate \"P-1\" to \"P-0\" on the digital display.\n5Pressure is again indicated on the digital display after three seconds.\nNOTE: Even if the power failure automatic recovery has not been set, the pressure indication will\n           return to the digital display after three seconds. \n\nOperation(continued)\n● During inspection of the safety relief valve, a loud noise will be emitted from the safety relief valve,\n    therefore, prepare for the noise in order to prevent personal injury.\n ● If there is excessive vibration or abnormal sound, please refer to page 25 for adjustment. \n● If the air compressor is not operating and the discharge stop valve is closed, the pressure indication\n    on the digital display may lower, which is due to a decrease in temperature. This is normal. \n● Turn off the power in the case of a power failure or electric storm to prevent damage to the air\n    compressor and/or personal injury.① Close the front door and fully open the\n    discharge stop valve. 3  Start Up  (Please contact the local Hitachi distributor for start up.)\n② Check the earth leakage (ground) circuit\n    breaker to make sure it is ON. Turn ON\n    the main power supply to the air\n    compressor.\n⑦ Open the discharge stop valve to lower the\n    pressure and verify that the air compressor\n    restarts at the load pressure setting.\n⑤ Close the stop valve on the air receiver\n    and verify that the operation of the air\n    compressor stops when the pressure\n    reaches maximum pressure (under\n    pressure switch control mode).\n    During operation of Multi-Drive control\n    mode, the SRL compressor heads will stop\n    one after another, and maximum pressure\n    will not be reached. This is not a failure.⑥ Slightly pull the spindle of the safety relief valve\n    when the air compressor is near maximum\n    pressure. \nSafety Relief\nValve\nON\nCAUTION\nSlightly pull the spindle of\nthe safety relief valve.\n19③ Press the Start switch.\n④ Verify that the rotating direction of the\n    main electric motor is clockwise when \n    viewed from the front as shown in the\n    diagram below.\nRotating\nDirection\n7.5/11M6 16.5M6\nNote) It is normal that the operation of the\n         air compressor restarts at a pressure\n         higher than the recovery pressure under\n         Multi-Drive control mode.\n˙Start\n    ① Completely open the stop valve on the air receiver.\n    ② Verify that the earth leakage (ground) circuit breaker is ON.\n    ③ Turn ON the main power supply.    ④ Select appropriate operation control mode of the air compressor.\n    ⑤ Press the Start switch.\n    ⑥ Automatic operation turns ON.\n■ Stop\n    ① Press the Stop switch.    ② Completely open the vertical air receiver stop valve to remove the residual pressure and depressurize\n        the system to 0 psig.\n    ③ Turn OFF the main power.\n ● Since the air compressor has the capacity to automatically start and stop when the Start switch has\n    been pressed, press the Stop switch and turn off the main power supply prior to inspecting the inside\n    of the air compressor. ● If the ambient temperature is above 104° F, the pressure indicated on the digital display may not read\n    0 psig, even if the air receiver has been de-pressurized. Ventilate to lower the ambient temperature.\n ● In the case of a power failure and/or electric storm, ensure that the main power supply has been\n     turned off. Pay attention that residual pressure may exist since there is no digital display.Operation(continued)\n4  Daily Operation\n ● Do not operate a damaged and/or improperly activated air compressor.\n ● Do not put any human body parts near the rotating parts of the air compressor during operation, as\n     they may become entangled and result in a serious injury. Take note that the air compressor has the\n     capability to automatically restart without notice.\n ● Do not touch the discharge piping in the front of the scroll head or the air piping leading to the air \n     receiver and the check valve, as they reach excessively high temperatures during operation and\n  　immediately after the air compressor has stopped. Failure to adhere to this precaution may lead to\n     burns.\nWARNING\nCAUTION\n20\n■ Daily inspections of the SRL air compressor are imperative to long safe operation.

The dryer is integrated in the bodywork\nand removes moisture from the compressed air.\nConnections\nThis compressor can be provided on the compressed air outlet and water pipes with:\nANSI flanges\nMotor temperature protection\nThermistors are embedded in the windings of the drive motor to warn the operator if the temperature becomes\ntoo high and to shut down the compressor, thereby protecting the motor from overheating.Instruction book\n17\nTeflon-free compressor elements\nThe rotors of the compressor elements have an epoxy-based coating.\nAutomatic water shut-off\nA water shut-off valve is provided in the cooling water system to shut off the system when the compressor is\nnot in operation.\nEnergy recovery\nThe compressor is provided with an Atlas Copco energy recovery system to recover the major part of the\ncompression heat in the form of hot water.\nSPM monitoring\nA number of vibration sensors are provided on the drive motor and compressor elements. The readings can\nbe called up on the display of the Elektronikon regulator.\nHigh ambient temperature (HAT)\nThe compressor is specially designed for continuous operation under humid and high ambient temperature\nconditions. The maximum ambient temperature is 50˚C (122˚F).\nPrepared for MD dryer with or without Pressure Dewpoint Sensor and/or Low load heater\nThe compressor is prepared for easy connection of an MD dryer. Plug in the connectors and connect the piping\nto the MD dryer and the compressor/MD combination is ready to start. The proper piping, the wiring and the\nconnectors will be delivered with the MD dryer.\nThe settings and parameters for the MD dryer are downloaded in the Elektronikon regulator of the compressor.\nAnchor pads\nSteel plates, fitting in the forklift slots, and bolts are shipped loose with the compressor. With these plates\nand bolts, the compressor frame can be fixed to the floor.\nAnti-condensation heaters\nElectric heaters are installed in the motor windings and connected to the compressor cubicle. When the\ncompressor is stopped, the heaters are automatically switched on. The heaters in the motor will prevent\ncondensation during stand-still.\nPDP sensor\nThe pressure dewpoint of the compressed air leaving the IMD dryer is continuously shown on the display of\nthe Elektronikon regulator. This allows to monitor the performance of the dryer and to make sure that the\ncompressed air is dry enough for the application.\nLow load compensator\nThe low load installation allows the dryer to be operated in low load conditions of the compressor. At these\nconditions (compressor in unload) the pressure dewpoint is maintained by purging a small amount of heated,\ndryed air through the rotor of the dryer.\nInstruction book\n18\nThe low load compensator is needed when the load cycle of the compressor is below 40 %.\nFull-Feature ND\nThe Z Full-Feature ND compressor has an integrated heat of compression rotary drum dryer. The regeneration\nair passes over a heater. The heater maintains a preset regeneration temperature to a have guaranteed dew\npoint at stated conditions. A thermostatic control puts on the heater and shuts it off automatically based on\nthe regeneration temperature requirements.\n2.2 Air flow\nFlow diagram, ZR\nInstruction book\n19\nFlow diagram, ZR Full-Feature\nInstruction book\n20\nFlow diagram, ZR Full-Feature ND and ZR Full-Feature with Low Load option\nInstruction book\n21\nFlow diagram, ZT\nInstruction book\n22\nFlow diagram, ZT Full-Feature\nInstruction book\n23\nFlow diagram, ZT Full-Feature ND and ZT Full-Feature with Low Load option\nRef Name\n(1) Air inlet\n(2) Air flow\n(3) Oil flow\n(4) Air outlet\n(5) Water flow\nInstruction book\n24\nAir flow\nAir drawn through filter (AF) is compressed in low-pressure compressor element (El) and discharged to\nintercooler (Ci). The cooled air is further compressed in high-pressure compressor element (Eh) and\ndischarged through silencer (AS) and aftercoolers. A check valve (CV) is provided downstream of the silencer.\nThe wet air from the aftercooler enters water separator (18) via the nozzle of ejector (14). In demister (19),\nthe water droplets are removed from the air. The air is then led through rotor (12), which adsorbs the water\nvapour.\nThe compressed air leaves the compressor via the air outlet.\nRegenerating circuit of the dryer\nHot regeneration air is branched off from the aftercooler. The regeneration air passes through shut-off valve\n(8), throttle valve (9) and strainer (10), and is blown through the wet rotor channels.\nThe hot saturated air is then cooled down in regeneration air cooler (11). The regeneration air is then mixed\nwith the wet compressed air from the compressor aftercooler.Instruction book\n25\n2.3 Condensate drain system\nFlow diagram, ZR\nInstruction book\n26\nFlow diagram, ZT\nExplanation of arrows\nRef Name\n(1) Air inlet\n(2) Air flow\n(3) Oil flow\n(4) Air outlet\n(5) Water flowInstruction book\n27\nDescription\nTwo condensate traps are installed: one downstream of the intercooler (MTi) to prevent condensate from\nentering compressor element (Eh) and one downstream of the aftercooler (MTa) to prevent condensate from\nentering the air outlet pipe. The condensate traps are connected to Electronic Water Drains (EWDi and EWDa\nrespectively).\nThe condensate enters the electronic water drain via inlet (1) and accumulates in collector (2). A capacitive\nsensor (3) continuously measures the liquid level. As soon as the collector is filled up to a certain level, pilot\nvalve (4) is activated and diaphragm (5) opens outlet (6), discharging the condensate. When the collector has\nbeen emptied, the outlet closes quickly without wasting compressed air.\nWhen the controller registers a malfunction, the red alarm LED starts flashing and the electronic drain valve\nwill automatically change to the alarm mode, opening and closing the valve according to a sequence as shown\nbelow.\nThis condition continues until the fault is remedied. If the fault is not remedied automatically, maintenance\nis required.\nTesting the Electronic water drain\nFunctional test\nInstruction book\n28\nBriefly press the TEST button and check that the valve opens for condensate discharge.\nChecking the alarm signal\n• Press the test button for at least 1 minute.\n• Check that the alarm LED flashes.\n• Release the test button.\n2.4 Oil system\nFlow diagram, ZR\nInstruction book\n29\nFlow diagram, ZT\nExplanation of arrows\nRef Name\n(1) Air inlet\n(2) Air flow\n(3) Oil flow\n(4) Water flow\n(4)\n(5)Air outlet\nOil system\nOn ZR compressors, oil is circulated by pump (OP) from the sump of the gear casing to cooler (Co).

Then,\nthe oil flows through the cooling jackets of compressor elements (El and Eh). From there, the oil flows through\nfilter (OF) towards the bearings and timing gears.\nValve (BV) opens if the oil pressure should rise above a given value.\n2.5 Cooling system\nFlow diagram, ZR\nInstruction book\n31\nFlow diagram, ZR Full-Feature\nInstruction book\n32\nFlow diagram, ZT\nInstruction book\n33\nFlow diagram, ZT Full-Feature\nExplanation of arrows\nRef Name\n(1) Air inlet\n(2) Air flow\n(3) Oil flow\n(4) Air outlet\n(5) Water flow\nInstruction book\n34\nCooling system, ZR compressors\nThe cooling system has two circuits:\n• One for the oil cooler (Co) and the cooling jackets of both compressor elements (Eh and El).\n• One for intercooler (Ci) and aftercooler (Ca).\nFull-Feature compressors have an extra cooling circuit for the regeneration cooler of the integrated dryer.\nCooling system, ZT compressors\nThe compressors are provided with an air-cooled oil cooler (Co), intercooler (Ci), pre-aftercooler (Ca1) and\naftercooler (Ca2). An electric motor-driven fan (FN) generates the cooling air.\nFull-Feature compressors have an aditional regeneration air cooler (11); the cooling air for this cooler is\ngenerated by an extra fan (13).\n2.6 Energy recovery\nGeneral\nThe system recovers the major part of the compression heat. The percentage of shaft input power available\nfor recovery is between 80 and 95, depending on the operating conditions.\nIf an MD dryer is installed downstream of the compressor, this percentage is reduced to approx. 70 of the\nshaft input instead of approx. 90, as part of the heat in the compressed air is used for regeneration in the drying\nprocess.\nA complete energy recovery system includes:\n• Compressor with modified cooling system (ZR)\n• A pump unit (PU) to transfer the recovered energy from the compressor cooling system to the heat\nconsumer (HC)\n• The heat consumer (HC), i.e. the equipment to transfer the energy to the industrial processInstruction book\n35\nModified cooling water system\nThe compressor cooling system has been modified to achieve both high cooling water temperatures and\nsufficient cooling for the compressor.\nThe cooling water enters the oil cooler and then flows through the high-pressure compressor element, the\nlow-pressure compressor element and finally the intercooler and the aftercooler. This sequence ensures\noptimal temperature differences with relation to the heat transfer in the individual components.\nOn Full-Feature compressors, additional connections are provided for the water circuit of the additional\naftercooler and the cooler of the IMD dryer. To ensure that the MD dryer works properly, low-temperature\ncooling water should be used for this cooling water circuit. The heat of this cooling water circuit is not\nrecovered by the energy recovery system.\nPump unit\nAtlas Copco supplies pump units to transfer the energy recovered from the compressor to the heat consumer\n(HC). The pump unit constitutes a closed water circuit with the compressor cooling system.\nTwo water pumps (WP1/2) are fitted. One pump circulates the hot cooling water from the compressor through\nthe heat consumer and back to the compressor. The other is a stand-by pump. Check valves (CV1/2) at the\ndelivery side of the pumps prevent backflow of water in the stand-by pump. The pump unit is fitted with a\nmake-up water connection, an air trap with automatic de-aeration device (AT), a pressure and temperature\ngauge (PI and TI), a safety valve (SV) and an expansion tank (ET).\nCooling water requirements\nClosed recirculating water systems minimise make-up water requirements. Therefore, it is economically\nfeasible to use softened water to eliminate the problem of scaling deposits.\nInstruction book\n36\nCorrosion control is important. The best results are obtained by adding corrosion inhibitors as used in engine\ncooling systems.\nUsing anti-freeze products is an alternative solution to avoid problems, e.g. adding 20 % to 30 % ethylene-\nglycol based anti-freeze to the tap water.\nFor open cooling water systems (e.g. boiler feed water preparation), consult the Atlas Copco Customer Centre\nto avoid problems related to deposit control, corrosion control and microbiological growth control.\nWater flow regulation through heat exchangers\nDepending on the amount of energy transferred in the heat consumer (HC), the heat exchanger (HE) of the\npump unit is completely or partly by-passed by means of a thermostatic valve (RV2). The valve is normally\nadjusted to achieve a cooling water temperature of 40 ˚C (corresponding to the maximum allowable\ntemperature at the compressor inlet). It is advisable to adjust the setting of the valve as close as possible to\nthe temperature of the cooling water returning from the heat consumer (HC).\nDepending on the amount of energy transferred in the heat consumer (HC), the heat exchanger (HE) of the\npump unit is completely or partly by-passed by means of a thermostatic valve (RV2). The valve is normally\nadjusted to achieve a cooling water temperature of 104 ˚F (corresponding to the maximum allowable\ntemperature at the compressor inlet). It is advisable to adjust the setting of the valve as close as possible to\nthe temperature of the cooling water returning from the heat consumer (HC).\nSufficient low-temperature cooling water must be available for the heat exchanger to achieve a water\ntemperature that does not exceed 40 ˚C/104 ˚F.\nElectrical system\nThe pumps (WP1 and WP2) are driven by an electric motor. Each motor is equipped with manual starting\nequipment including a circuit breaker.\nThe first time it is started, check that the rotation direction matches the direction indicated by the arrows on\nthe motor flanges. If necessary, stop the unit, switch off the voltage and reverse two incoming electric lines.\nImportant remarks\nCompressed air quality and reliability of any compressor, dryer or other equipment should never be made\nsubordinate to the energy recovery system. In some cases, especially installations where air dryers are\ninstalled, an additional aftercooler is required to reduce the compressor air outlet temperature to a level at\nwhich the dryers operate at maximum efficiency. This aftercooler and the dryer (if water-cooled) need to be\ncooled separately by low-temperature water. Consult the Atlas Copco Customer Centre.\nThe general temperature level of compressors with a modified cooling system for energy recovery is approx.\n20 to 25 ˚C (68 to 77 ˚F) higher than the level of compressors with a standard cooling system, resulting in a\nslight decrease in free air delivery and a slight increase in shaft power.\nIn case the compressors operate in high ambient temperatures and with high water inlet temperatures, the\nmaximum working pressure is 0.5 bar (7.25 psi) lower than for standard compressors. Consult the Atlas Copco\nCustomer Centre.Instruction book\n37\nSettings - limitations\nItem Setting\nMaximum cooling water temperature at compressor\noutlet90 ˚C (85 ˚C if MD dryer is fitted)\n194 ˚F (185 ˚F if MD dryer is fitted)\nMaximum cooling water temperature at compressor\ninlet40 ˚C\n104 ˚F\nSafety valve opening pressure 2.5 bar(e)\n36.3 psig\n2.7 Low load compensator\nDescription\nReference Name\n1 Low load during unload cycle\n2 Heater\n3 Air net\n4 Rotor\n5 Motor\n6 Cooler\n7 Solenoid valve\n8 Silencer\n9 Air outlet (compressor)\n10 Mechanical link\n11 Drain\n12 Water\n13 No air flow\n14 Air flow\n15 Flow direction\nInstruction book\n38\nReference Name\n16 Regeneration air (compressor)\nUsing the low load installation will allow the dryer to operate in low load conditions of the compressor.

A number of programmable settings, e.g. the unloading and loading pressures, the minimum\nstop time and the maximum number of motor starts are taken into account.\nThe regulator stops the compressor whenever possible to reduce the power consumption and restarts it\nautomatically when the net pressure decreases. In case the expected unloading period is too short, the\ncompressor is kept running to prevent too short standstill periods.\nA number of time-based automatic start/stop commands may be programmed. Take into\naccount that a start command will be executed (if programmed and activated), even after\nmanually stopping the compressor.\nProtecting the compressor\nShut-down\nInstruction book\n42\nSeveral sensors are provided on the compressor. If one of these measurements exceeds the programmed shut-\ndown level, the compressor will be stopped. This will be indicated on display (1) and general alarm LED (2)\nwill blink.\nRemedy the trouble and reset the message. See also the Status data menu.\nBefore remedying, consult the Safety precautions.\nShut-down warning\nA shut-down warning level is a programmable level below the shut-down level.\nIf one of the measurements exceeds the programmed shut-down warning level, a message will appear on\ndisplay (1) and general alarm LED (2) will light up, to warn the operator that the shut-down warning level is\nexceeded.\nThe message disappears as soon as the warning condition disappears.\nService warning\nA number of service operations are grouped (called Level A, B, C, ...). Each level has a programmed time\ninterval. If a time interval is exceeded, a message will appear on display (1) to warn the operator to carry out\nthe service actions belonging to that level.\nAutomatic restart after voltage failure\nThe regulator has a built-in function to automatically restart the compressor if the voltage is restored after\nvoltage failure. For compressors leaving the factory, this function is made inactive. If desired, the function\ncan be activated. Consult the Atlas Copco Customer Centre.\nIf activated and provided the regulator was in the automatic operation mode, the\ncompressor will automatically restart if the supply voltage to the module is restored within\na programmed time period.\nThe power recovery time (the period within which the voltage must be restored to have an\nautomatic restart) can be set between 1 and 3600 seconds or to “Infinite”. If the power\nrecovery time is set to “Infinite”, the compressor will always restart after a voltage failure,\nno matter how long it takes to restore the voltage. A restart delay can also be programmed,\nallowing e.g. two compressors to be restarted one after the other.Instruction book\n43\n3.2 Control panel\nElektronikon regulator\nControl panel\nParts and functions\nReference Designation Function\n1 Start button Button to start the compressor.

See Elektronikon regulator.\nCompressor\nelement 1/2Element 1 stands for the low-pressure compressor element; element 2 stands for the high-\npressure compressor element.\nThe regulator does not accept illogical settings, e.g. if the warning level is programmed at\n205 ˚C, the minimum limit for the shut-down level changes into 206 ˚C. The recommended\ndifference between the warning level and shut-down level is 10 ˚C.Instruction book\n71\nTerm Explanation\nCompressor\nelement 1/2Element 1 stands for the low-pressure compressor element; element 2 stands for the high-\npressure compressor element.\nThe regulator does not accept illogical settings, e.g. if the warning level is programmed at\n401 ˚F, the minimum limit for the shut-down level changes into 402 ˚F. The recommended\ndifference between the warning level and shut-down level is 18 ˚F.\nRequired stop\nperiod/Minimum\nstop timeOnce the compressor is automatically stopped, it will remain stopped for the minimum stop\ntime (approx. 20 seconds), whatever happens with the air net pressure. In automatic\noperation, the compressor will not be stopped by the regulator until a standstill period of\nat least the sum of the minimum stop time and required stop period is expected. However,\nif the decrease in air net pressure should require a new start of the compressor, the\nregulator will start the compressor after the minimum stop time.\nPower recovery\ntimeIs the period within which the voltage must be restored to have an automatic restart. Is\naccessible if the automatic restart is activated. To activate the automatic restart function,\nconsult Atlas Copco.\nUnloading/\nLoading pressureThe regulator does not accept illogical settings, e.g. if the unloading pressure is\nprogrammed at 7.0 bar(e), the maximum limit for the loading pressure changes into 6.9\nbar(e). The recommended minimum pressure difference between loading and unloading\nis 0.6 bar.\nUnloading/\nLoading pressureThe regulator does not accept illogical settings, e.g. if the unloading pressure is\nprogrammed at 101 psig, the maximum limit for the loading pressure changes into 100\npsig. The recommended minimum pressure difference between loading and unloading is\n9 psig.\nDelay at shut-\ndown signalIs the period during which the signal must exist before the compressor is shut down. If it\nshould be required to program this setting at another value, consult Atlas Copco.\nInstruction book\n72\n4 Installation\n4.1 Dimension drawings\nDimension drawing, ZR Pack\nInstruction book\n73\nDimension drawing, ZR Pack with energy recovery\nInstruction book\n74\nDimension drawing, ZR Full-Feature\nInstruction book\n75\nDimension drawing, ZR Full-Feature with energy recovery\nInstruction book\n76\nDimension drawing, ZT Pack\nInstruction book\n77\nDimension drawing, ZT Full-Feature\nText on drawing\nRef Name\n(1) Voltage supply entry\n(2) Compressed air outlet\n(3) Cooling air outlet\n(4) Opening for transportation\n(5) 4 slotted holes only for horizontally pulling unit out of container\nInstruction book\n78\nRef Name\n(6) Cooling air inlet\n(7) Hole pattern ducting\n(8) Automatic drain, aftercooler\n(9) Automatic drain, intercooler\n(10) Compressed air outlet, compensator\n(11) Mass\n(12) Water in/out compensator\n(13) Water out\n(14) Water in\n(15) Automatic drain, dryer inlet\n(17) Automatic drain, dryer outlet\n(18) Cooling Full-Feature air outlet\n(19) Cooling Full-Feature air inlet\n(20) If option: Prepared for MD\n(21) Cable box included for EC variants\n(22) Cable box not included for CSA/UL variants\n(23) Automatic drain, regeneration outlet\n(24) Low load drain (optional)\n(25) Automatic drain, extra aftercoolerInstruction book\n79\n4.2 Installation proposals\nInstallation proposal, ZR Pack, ZR Full-Feature and ZR Pack with energy recovery\nInstruction book\n80\nInstallation proposal, ZR Full-Feature with energy recovery\nInstruction book\n81\nInstallation proposal, ZT Pack\nInstruction book\n82\nInstallation proposal, ZT Full-Feature\nText on figures\nRef Name\n(1) Minimum free area to be reserved\n(2) Ventilation proposal\n(3) Cooling air outletInstruction book\n83\nRef Name\n(4) Cooling air inlet\n(5) Cooling Full-Feature air outlet\n(6) Cooling Full-Feature air inlet\nDescription\nRef Description\n1 Install the compressor on a level floor suitable for taking the weight of the compressor.\nRecommended minimum distance between the top of the bodywork and the ceiling: 1200\nmm (46.80 in).\n2 Remove the plastic plug or cap (if provided) from the compressor air outlet pipe and install\nan air outlet valve. Close the valve and connect it to the air net.\n3 The pressure drop over the delivery pipe can be calculated as follows:\ndp = (L x 450 x Qc1.85) / (d5 x P)\n•dp = pressure drop (recommended maximum = 0.1 bar)\n•L = length of outlet pipe in m\n•d = inner diameter of the delivery pipe in mm\n•P = absolute pressure at the compressor outlet in bar(a)\n•Qc = free air delivery of the compressor in l/s\nThe connection of the compressor air delivery pipe should be made on top of the main air\nnet pipe to minimize carry-over of possible remainder of condensate.\n4 The inlet grids and ventilation fan should be installed in such a way that any recirculation\nof cooling air to the compressor is avoided.\nThe air velocity to the grids should be limited to 5 m/s (195 in/s).\nThe required ventilation capacity (per compressor installed) to limit the compressor room\ntemperature can be calculated as follows:\nOn ZR compressors: Qv = 0.1 N / dT\nOn ZT compressors: Qv = 0.92 N/ dT\n•Qv = required ventilation capacity in m3/s\n•N = shaft input of the compressor in kW\n•dT = temperature rise over ambient in ˚C\nIf cooling air ducts are installed, the maximum allowable pressure drop over the ducts is\n30 Pa. Common ducting for several compressors is not allowed.\n5 Lay out the drain piping from automatic condensate outlets (EWD) towards the condensate\ncollector.

In a closed\nsystem, the same cooling water circulates through a system without contact with air.\nAn open system is a pass-through system, or a circulating system with a cooling tower. In the latter case, the\ncomposition of the water that enters the cooler must be considered, and not the composition of the make-up\nwater. Due to the evaporative effect in the cooling tower, much higher concentrations of ions can be obtained\nin the circulating water than in the make-up water.\nRyznar stability index (RSI)\nThe Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) is a parameter for predicting whether water will tend to dissolve or precipitate\ncalcium carbonate. The adhesion of scaling deposits and their effect are different on different materials, but\nthe equilibrium of the water (scaling or corrosive) is only determined by its actual pH value and by the\nsaturation pH value (pH s).\nThe saturation pH value is determined by the relationship between the calcium hardness, the total alkalinity,\nthe total solids concentration and the temperature.\nThe Ryznar Index is calculated as follows :\nRSI = 2*pH s - pH\nSymbol Explanation\npH Measured pH (at room temperature) of water sample\npHs pH at saturation\nThe pH s is calculated by using :\npHs = (9.3 + A + B) - (C + D)\nInstruction book\n90\nSymbol Explanation\nA Depends on the total solids concentration (mg/l)\nB Depends on the highest cooling water temperature (˚C/˚F), (T=65 ˚C/149 ˚F)\nC Depends on the calcium hardness (ppm CaCO 3)\nD Depends on the HCO 3- concentration or M-alkalinity (mval/l)\nThe values of A, B, C and D can be found in the following table.\nTotal dissolved\nsolids (mg/l)A Temperature\n(˚C)B Ca-hardness (ppm\nCaCO 3)C M-alkalinity (mval/l) D\n50 - 300 0.1 0 - 1 2.6 10 - 11 0.6 0.20 - 0.22 1.0\n400-1000 0.2 2 - 6 2.5 12 - 13 0.7 0.24 - 0.26 1.1\n  7 - 9 2.4 14 - 17 0.8 0.28 - 0.34 1.2\n  10 - 13 2.3 18 - 22 0.9 0.36 - 0.44 1.3\n  14 - 17 2.2 23 - 27 1.0 0.46 - 0.54 1.4\n  18 - 21 2.1 28 - 34 1.1 0.56 - 0.70 1.5\n  22 - 27 2.0 35 - 43 1.2 0.72 - 0.88 1.6\n  28 - 31 1.9 44 - 55 1.3 0.90 - 1.10 1.7\n  32 - 37 1.8 56 - 69 1.4 1.12 - 1.38 1.8\n  38 - 44 1.7 70 - 87 1.5 1.40 - 1.76 1.9\n  45 - 50 1.6 88 - 110 1.6 1.78 - 2.20 2.0\n  51 - 56 1.5 111 - 138 1.7 2.22 - 2.78 2.1\n  57 - 63 1.4 138 - 174 1.8 2.80 - 3.54 2.2\n  64 - 71 1.3 175 - 220 1.9 3.54 - 4.40 2.3\n  72 - 80 1.2 230 - 270 2.0 4.6 - 5.4 2.4\n    280 - 340 2.1 5.6 - 7.0 2.5\n    350 - 430 2.2 7.2 - 8.8 2.6\n    440 - 550 2.3 9.0 - 11.0 2.7\n    560 - 690 2.4 11.2 - 13.8 2.8\n    700 - 870 2.5 14.0 - 17.6 2.9\n    880 - 1000 2.6 17.8 - 20.0 3.0\nInterpretation of the value obtained\nRSI Water condition Action\nRSI<3.9 Very high scale formation Water cannot be used.\n4.0<RSI<5.5 High boiler scale formation Regular inspection and descaling operation\nnecessary.\n5.6<RSI<6.2 Slight boiler scale formation Water treatment not necessary.\nOccasional inspection recommended.\n6.3<RSI<6.8 Neutral water Water treatment not necessary.\nOccasional inspection recommended.\n6.9<RSI<7.5 Slight corrosion at higher\ntemperatureWater treatment not necessary.\nOccasional inspection recommended.Instruction book\n91\nRSI Water condition Action\n7.6<RSI<9.0 Strong corrosion Regular inspection necessary, use of corrosion\ninhibitor recommended.\n9.1<RSI<11 Very strong corrosion Regular inspection necessary, use of corrosion\ninhibitor required.\nRSI>11 Very strong corrosion in\ncomplete water systemWater should not be used.\nThe table indicates that distilled or demineralised water should never be used, as their RSI is > 11.\nThe RSI only indicates the equilibrium of scaling - descaling. A cooling water showing good RSI conditions\ncan still be unsuitable due to other factors.\nFrom the table above, the RSI index should be between 5.6 and 7.5; otherwise, contact a specialist.\npH\nThe effect of pH is already calculated in the Ryznar index, but the pH itself has some additional limitations :\n6.8 < pH < 8.5\nTotal dissolved solids (TDS)\nThis is the sum of all the ions in the water. It can be derived from the dry residue after evaporation (but not\nincluding suspended solids), or it can be estimated from the electrical conductivity.\nIn a closed system, the following limits apply : TDS < 3000 mg/l (< 3800 microS/cm)\nFor an open system, the following limits apply : TDS < 750 mg/l ( < 960 microS/cm)\nChlorides (Cl-)\nChloride ions will create pitting corrosion on stainless steel.

The plugs are painted green and their positions are\nshown below.\nInstruction book\n100\nInstruction book\n101\n• On ZR compressors, check that the cooling water drain valves (customer's installation) in the inlet and\noutlet lines are closed. Open the water inlet valve and outlet valve (customer's installation) and check for\nwater flow.\n•On ZR Full-Feature, the inlet and outlet valves of the cooling water circuit of the regeneration cooler must\nbe opened completely.\n• Check that the gear casing is filled with oil: the level should be in the middle of sight-glass (SG).\nInstruction book\n102\n• Check that the electrical connections correspond to the local codes. The installation must be earthed and\nprotected by fuses in all phases. An isolating switch must be provided.\n• Check the connections at the primary sides of transformers (T1 and T2).\nTypical exampleInstruction book\n103\nTypical example\n•Switch on the voltage. Start the compressor and stop it immediately. Check for correct direction of rotation\nwhile the motor is coasting to a stop. An arrow on the gear casing indicates the correct rotation direction.\nIf the rotation direction is wrong, switch off the voltage and reverse two incoming electric lines.\n• On ZT compressors, remove panel (1) and check the rotation direction of the fan motor. If the rotation\ndirection is wrong, switch off the voltage and reverse two connections at terminals 221 up to 226 of terminal\nstrip (1X1).\nOn ZT Full-Feature compressors, also check the rotation of the fan motor of the regeneration cooler (Cr),\nthe correct rotation direction is indicated by an arrow on the fan motor.\n• Run the compressor for a few minutes and check that it operates normally.\n• Stop the compressor. If necessary, top up the gear casing with oil to the middle of sight-glass (SG).\nInstruction book\n104\nAdjustment of the pressure difference of the dryer compartments\nDelta P indicator\nView of PDP sensorInstruction book\n105\nView of throttle valve\nTo start up the unit for the first time or after a long period of standstill, proceed as follows:\n1.Check if U-tube is filled halfway with water. If not, continue as follows:\n• Close the valves (9 and 10) and open valve (6).\n• Remove the plugs (8) of the two vent valves (7) of the delta P indicator and open the valves.\n• Fill the U-tube halfway with water, close the valves (7) and refit the plugs.\n2. On compressors equipped with a PDP sensor, close valve (11) to this sensor.\n3.For dryers with low load option: Check that circuit breaker (F 32, compressor cubicle) is in the \"I\" position.\n4. Close the manual drain valve of the aftercooler drain trap of the compressor.\n5. On ZR compressors, check for water flow.\n6. Switch on the voltage at the mains.\n7. Start and load the compressor.\n8. Open the valve (if installed) to the air net or air receiver and blow off some air from the air net to keep\nthe compressor running loaded.\n9. Open valves (9 and 10). Open valve (6) slightly, while monitoring the water levels in the U-tube.\nThere are two possible conditions:\n•The water level in the leg marked (+) rises. Close valve (6) at once, decrease the regeneration air inlet\npressure (see next step). Do this as often as necessary until the water level drops.\n• The water level in the leg marked (-) rises, which should normally be the case. If the level in this leg\nrises 30 mm above the level in the leg marked (+), close valve (6) at once, as there is a risk that the\nwater will escape the U-tube and disappear into the pressure vessel. Increase the regeneration air inlet\npressure (see next step) and open valve (6) again.\n10.Once the water column has stabilised, adjust the pressure differential as follows:\n• Remove the protective cap from the adjusting screw of throttle valve (12).\n• Loosen its check nut (13) and turn the screw to alter the pressure differential.\n• Monitor the water level for about 10 minutes.\n• Tighten the check nut and reinstall the protective cap.\n11.
