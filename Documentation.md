# Production-Ready AI-Powered Marine Knowledge System (MK-AI)

---

## Executive Summary

### Business Requirement
Marine field technicians and engineers need immediate, on-site access to critical technical drawings, manuals, and troubleshooting guides—without returning to the office for document retrieval and printing.

### Current Pains
- **Time Delays:** Manual searches and print-outs consume 10–15 minutes per query, magnified in emergencies.  
- **Inefficiency:** Office trips interrupt operations and reduce equipment uptime.  
- **Safety Risks:** Slow access to safety or troubleshooting documents can compromise crew well-being.

### Successful Solution
Deploy a Production-Ready AI-Powered Marine Knowledge System (MK-AI) that delivers:
1. **Sub-second** semantic search via AI embeddings  
2. **Intelligent cross-document linkage** (e.g., part → drawing → manual)  
3. **Offline access** through a Progressive Web App (PWA)  
4. **Seamless integration** with Hexagon EDMS for real-time accuracy  

---

## Gains and Benefits
1. **Time Savings**  
   - Search times drop from minutes to seconds.  
2. **Improved Accuracy**  
   - Always surfaces the latest document versions with built-in version-control metadata.  
3. **Enhanced Usability**  
   - Natural language queries remove exact-keyword dependencies; OCR supports scanned content.  
4. **Better Decision-Making**  
   - Smart linking provides contextual “next steps.”  
5. **Cross-Document Intelligence**  
   - Knowledge graph connects fragmented data for holistic insights.  
6. **Resilience & Reliability**  
   - Offline sync ensures continuity in remote environments.  
7. **Scalability**  
   - Architected for millions of documents and thousands of concurrent queries.

## Potential Approaches
- **Semantic Search with AI Embeddings**  
  Sentence-BERT → vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Qdrant)  
- **OCR for Image-Based Content**  
  Cloud OCR (Google Document AI, AWS Textract) → text extraction  
- **Smart Linking / Knowledge Graph**  
  NER/RE pipelines → Neo4j graph database  
- **Offline Access / PWA**  
  Service Workers + IndexedDB for selective sync  
- **Rule-Based Search**  
  Regex pipelines for highly structured documents  
- **Full-Text Search Engine**  
  Elasticsearch/Solr for unstructured text indexing  

---

## High-Level Solution Design
1. **Phase 0: Architecture & Integration Planning**  
   - Define HA/scalability/security  
   - Hexagon EDMS API strategy & test plan  
2. **Phase 1: Core Semantic Indexing Pipeline**  
   - PDF/OCR ingestion → embedding generation → vector DB  
   - Backend API + prototype UI  
3. **Phase 2: Intelligent Linking & Knowledge Graph**  
   - Train custom NER/RE models  
   - Populate & expose graph-DB endpoints  
4. **Phase 3: Production Application**  
   - Secure, scalable API & responsive web/mobile UI  
   - Offline sync mechanism  
   - CI/CD, monitoring, and UAT

## Impact on Business & Technology

| Approach                  | Business Impact                                        | Technical Impact                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Semantic Search           | Dramatic reduction in search times                     | ML infrastructure, embedding store, query servers       |
| OCR                       | Enables access to legacy/scanned docs                  | OCR service costs; preprocessing pipeline               |
| Knowledge Graph           | Deep contextual linking; audit trails                  | Annotation effort; graph-DB management                  |
| Offline PWA               | Ensures access in no-connectivity zones                | Sync/resync complexity; local storage management        |
| Rule-Based Search         | Fast for well-structured docs                          | Rigid; high maintenance when docs evolve                |
| Full-Text Search Engine   | Rapid, scalable unstructured text retrieval            | Lacks semantic ranking; requires relevance tuning       |

## Risks
- **OCR Limitations:** Poor-quality scans or handwriting may fail.  
- **Data Annotation:** NER/RE model training is labor- and time-intensive.  
- **Model Accuracy:** Generic NLP models need fine-tuning for marine jargon.  
- **Security Complexity:** EDMS authentication & authorization integration is non-trivial.  
- **Offline Engineering:** Reliable sync/resync logic adds engineering overhead.  
- **User Adoption:** Requires change management and training.

---

## Improved Business Processes
- **Semantic Search:** Eliminates office trips for quick lookups.  
- **OCR Indexing:** Digitizes paper archives for instant retrieval.  
- **Knowledge Graph:** Visually surfaces related assets for faster troubleshooting.  
- **Offline PWA:** Uninterrupted access in remote or connectivity-challenged locales.  
- **Rule-Based Queries:** Quick wins for standardized document types.

---

## Constraints, Limitations & Assumptions
- **Constraints:**  
  - Must handle millions of documents with 99.99% uptime.  
  - Initial PoC limited to sample data; full EDMS integration deferred to later phases.  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - Hexagon EDMS API credentials and sample datasets are available.  
  - Cloud budget is approved for OCR and vector-DB services.  
  - Field devices (tablets/handhelds) support PWA storage requirements.
