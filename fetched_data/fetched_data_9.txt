3.17 Modifying service plans
Function
To modify the hour intervals for the service levels.
Service plans
The service actions to be carried out are grouped in plans called Service level A, B, C or D. When reaching
an interval, a message will appear on the screen indicating which Service plans are to be carried out.Instruction book

[zr55.pdf, page 44]Several sensors are provided on the compressor. If one of these measurements exceeds the programmed shut-
down level, the compressor will be stopped. This will be indicated on display (1) and general alarm LED (2)
will blink.
Remedy the trouble and reset the message. See also the Status data menu.
Before remedying, consult the Safety precautions.
Shut-down warning
A shut-down warning level is a programmable level below the shut-down level.
If one of the measurements exceeds the programmed shut-down warning level, a message will appear on
display (1) and general alarm LED (2) will light up, to warn the operator that the shut-down warning level is
exceeded.
The message disappears as soon as the warning condition disappears.
Service warning
A number of service operations are grouped (called Level A, B, C, ...). Each level has a programmed time
interval. If a time interval is exceeded, a message will appear on display (1) to warn the operator to carry out
the service actions belonging to that level.
Automatic restart after voltage failure
The regulator has a built-in function to automatically restart the compressor if the voltage is restored after
voltage failure. For compressors leaving the factory, this function is made inactive. If desired, the function
can be activated. Consult the Atlas Copco Customer Centre.
If activated and provided the regulator was in the automatic operation mode, the
compressor will automatically restart if the supply voltage to the module is restored within
a programmed time period.
The power recovery time (the period within which the voltage must be restored to have an
automatic restart) can be set between 1 and 3600 seconds or to “Infinite”. If the power
recovery time is set to “Infinite”, the compressor will always restart after a voltage failure,
no matter how long it takes to restore the voltage. A restart delay can also be programmed,
allowing e.g. two compressors to be restarted one after the other.Instruction book

[125200.pdf, page 50]487.0 OTIONS
7.1 POWER OUTAGE RESTART OPTION
For customers that have interruptions in their incomingpower supply to the compressor and must maintain anuninterrupted supply of compressed air, the PowerOutage Restart Option allows an Intellisyscompressor torestart automatically 10-120 seconds (adjustable) afterincoming power is restored.
The Power Outage Restart Option is turned on by
plugging in the required option module and enabling itthru the OPTION’S set point routine.The restart timedelay, which is adjustable from 10-600 seconds, can alsobe adjusted while in the option’s set routine on theIntellisys controller.Any time power is restored to thecompressor after a power interruption, a horn located onthe side of the starter box will sound during the restarttime delay (10-600 seconds), after which the compressorwill automatically start.After starting, the compressor willreturn to the mode of operation that the compressor wasin prior to the power interruption.
This option may be factory installed or a field installation
kit is available.
7.2 SEQUENCER
The sequencer option is turned on by enabling it throughthe OPTIONS set point routine.Enabling thisoption will allow the compressor to be controlled by anexternal device, such as an ISC or sequencer, usingthe communications port (P7) on the Intellisys.
7.3 LOW AMBIENT
The lowambient option is turned on by enabling it throughthe OPTIONS set point routine.Also temperature sensor,3CTT, is added to the compressor and connected at P6-7& 8 on the Intellisys.The options set point, minimumcooler out temperature, is set to the minimum temperatureat which the unit can load.When this option is enabled,the compressor, after being started, will not load until theIntellisys reads a temperature from 3CTT at or higherthan the value of the minimum cooler out temperature setpoint.If this option is enabled without installing 3CTT,
a SENSOR FAILURE 3CTT alarm will occur.
7.4 SEPARATOR DELTA-P SOLENOID
The separator delta-p solenoid option is turned on byenabling it through the OPTIONS set point routine.When this option is enabled, the Intellisys will measurethe pressure drop across the separator element byfirst reading the wet side sump pressure.Next theIntellisys will momentarily energize solenoid that willswitch the dry side sump pressure to the sump pressuresensor (3APT).The Intellisys will then read the dryside sump pressure and subtract it from the wet sidesump pressure to measure the pressure drop across theseparator element. Do not enable this option if the
separator delta-p solenoid is not installed.This willresult in an incorrect measurement of the pressuredrop across the separator element.
7.5 SEPARATOR   DELTA-P SENSOR
The separator delta-p sensor option is turned on byenabling it through the OPTIONS set point routine.When this option is enabled, the Intellisys will measurethe pressure drop across the separator element bysubtracting the dry side sump pressure (6APT) from thewet side sump pressure (3APT). Do not enable this
option if the separator delta-p sensor is not installed.This will result in an incorrect measurement of thepressure drop across the separator element and a6APT sensor failure warning.
7.6 HIGH DUST FILTER
The high dust filter option is turned on by enabling itthrough the OPTIONS set point routine.If this optionis enabled, the Intellisys;will change its measurement ofthe inlet filter. Do not enable this option unless a high
dust filter is installed.
7.7 LEAD/LAG CYCLE LENGTH
The lead/lag cycle length option allows the Intellisys toautomatically switch the online and offline pressuresettingsto the lead or lag values after a programmednumber of hours.This option is enabled by selecting anumber of hours greater than 0 in the OPTIONS set pointroutine.
7.8 SCHEDULEDSTART/STOP
The scheduled start/stop option allows the customer toautomatically start and stop the compressor once eachday, based on the real time clock.This is an installedoption and is enabled by selecting a scheduled start andscheduled stop time.Setting the scheduled start andscheduled stop times to the same value will disable thisoption.
