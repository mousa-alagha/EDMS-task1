  Unless otherwise noted, the pressure unit MPa represents the gauge pressure in this manual. 
  For limits of working temperature and pressure, see "2.3.2 Operation Limits" in this manual. 
   *Note 1 : Data include a weight of a flange mo tor spacer of the NEMA standards.  
   *Note 2: The design pressure varies according to each area, laws and ordinances of the country.  
          The design pressure of this list is the maximu m value of the compressor. Therefore, the  
         real design pressure may become less t han this value according to the law.  
         Please confirm real pressure on a name plate and individual specifications.

Screw Compressor  i-series 2.1 Features of i-Series Compressor   
2-1 Chapter 2 Compressor Specifications and Configuration 
 
2.1 Features of          i-Series Compressor 
              i-series compressor enables designers to design highly reliable and most compact 
refrigerating unit. It has a lot of features. 
 Centering is made unnecessary by mounting the motor using a flange. 
By mounting the motor using a flange eliminates th e need of the troublesome motor centering before 
starting the equipment.  
 Suction strainer and check valve built-in compressor 
This compressor has built-in suction strainer and check valve which enable easy maintenance. 
 No oil pump required in differential pressure oil supply system 
This compressor employs roller bearings which let lubrication oil reserved in part even when the 
machine is stopped. Accordingly, no lubrication failure will occur even with differential pressure oil 
supply system which has no oil pump installed.  
 3-step (100%, 75%, 50%) unloader 
As it has a 3-step (100%, 75%, 50%) unloader built-in, flow adjustment can be done easily. 
Inverter-controlled speed control is available. 
 High efficiency, and low vibration and noise 
Use of            original screw rotor profile attains high efficiency, and low vibration and noise. 
 
 
2.2 Model Designation of the Compressor 
This manual describes i125*-* and i160*-* models. 
The meaning of the type designation, which is eng raved on the MODEL column of the compressor 
nameplate, is as follows. 
 
 i 1 2 5 * - * 
 
         Specifications of Vi (volume ratio)  of the discharge port, which is L (Vi=2.63), M (Vi=3.65) 
or H (Vi=5.80)   
        Specifications of rotor length, which is S or L (i125) and S, M or L (i160) 
         Rotor diameter, which is 125 or 160
