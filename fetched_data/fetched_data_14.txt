The name and value of each of the items listed can beseen by moving the list up and down using the arrowbuttons.Pressing the ALARM button will return thedisplay to the Alarm screen and the RESET button.The Alarm needs to be reset by the operator bypressing the RESET button twice.Any exceptions tothis are explained in the alarm descriptions.When an Alarm occurs, an exclamation mark will flashon the display screen as shown above.The displaymessage will indicate what caused the Alarm.Pressing the STATUS button will display the ALARMSTATUS screen with the ALARM button indicating anAlarm still exists.Alarm Status is the list of machineoperating conditions that existed at the time of theAlarm.COMMUNICATION FAIL 1 (or 2 - 4) - This warning
will occur if the compressor is the lead unit while usingintegral sequencing and is unable to communicate withanother compressor.
SERVICED REQUIRED - The Intellisys has 2 levels of
service.The service level can be set at the factory or
by an Ingersoll-Rand service representative.Eitherservice level will issue a “SERVICE REQUIRED”warning at 150 hours.This warning is a reminder forinitial service and can be cleared by the operator.
Level 1 - If service level 1 (default) is selected, a
“SERVICE REQUIRED”warning will be issued every2000 operating hours.This warning is to serve as areminder to have the unit serviced and can be clearedby the operator.Level 2 - If service level 2 is selected, servicewarnings will be issued every 2000 operating hours(default) or in 3, 6, 9, or 12 month intervals, asselected at the factory or by an I-R servicerepresentative.Service warnings at level 2 are issuedin 3 stages.First a “100 HOURS TO SERVICE”or 14DAYS TO SERVICE”(depending on the serviceinterval type) warning will be issued.This warning willlet the operator know that the time for service isapproaching and can be cleared by the operator.Following that, 100 hours or 14 days later a “SERVICEREQUIRED”warning will be issued.This warning canbe temporarily cleared by the operator, however it willreturn 24 hours later if service has not been performedby an I-R service representative.A new service periodwill start when service is performed.If another 100hours or 14 days elapses and service has not beenperformed, an “ALARM-SERVICE REQUIRED”warning will be issued.This warning can only becleared by an I-R service representative.
SENSOR FAILURE 6APT - This warning will occur if
the separator delta-p sensor option is installed and
sensor 6APT is recognized as missing or broken.
273.11 WARNINGS (CONTINUED)
---
[125200.pdf, page 30]28The possible Alarm messages are as follows.
CHECK INLET CONTROL- This will occur if the
machine is unloaded and the inlet vacuum is less than
3 psig (.2 bar).
CHECK INLET CTRL SYS 1 (2) - This will occur if the
inlet butterfly valve fails to open or close properly.A 1
means the inlet valve failed to closer properly.A 2means the inlet valve failed to open properly.
CHECK MOTOR ROTATION- This will occur if the
machine is started and the compressor has incorrect
rotation.
CONTROL POWER LOSS- This will occur if the
controller detects a loss of the 110 VAC or 120 VAC
control power.
EMERGENCY STOP- This will occur if the Emergency
Stop button is engaged.The button must be
disengaged before the alarm can be cleared.
FAN MOTOR OVERLOAD- This will occur if a fan
motor overload is sensed.HIGH AIREND DISCH TEMP- This will occur if the
airend discharge temperature is greater than 228°F(109°C).
LOW SUMP AIR PRESSURE- This will occur if the
machine is running fully loaded and the sump pressure
drops below 20 psig (1.4 bar).
LOW UNLOAD SUMP PRESS- This will occur if the
machine is running unloaded and the sump pressure
is less than 15 psig (1.0 bar) for 15 seconds.
MAIN MOTOR OVERLOAD- This will occur if a drive
motor overload is sensed.CHECK SET POINTS- This will occur if the controller
has determined some of the data stored in memory
contains unacceptable values.When this occurs, thesensors should be calibrated and all the set pointschecked.It is normal for this alarm to occur afterchanging controller software.REMOTE START FAILURE- This will occur if the
Remote Start button is pressed after the machine isrunning or if the Remote Start button remains closed.
REMOTE STOP FAILURE- This will occur if the
Remote Stop button remains open and either Start
button is pressed.
SENSOR FAILURE 1AVPT (or 3APT,4APT,
5CPT,2CTT,2ATT,3CTT) - This will occur if a sensor
is recognized as missing or broken.This does notapply to sensor 4ATT.
STARTER FAULT 1SL (2SL)- This will occur if the
starter contacts open while the machine is running.It
will also occur if the machine is given the stopcommand and the starter contacts do not open.1SLrefers to the auxiliary circuit on starter contact 1M.2SLrefers to the auxiliary circuit on starter contacts 2Mand 1S.
STEPPER LIMIT SWITCH- This will occur if both limit
switches are activated at the same time.INVALID CALIBRATION- This will occur during the
calibration process if the sensor reads greater than
20% of scale.
LOW COOLANT PRESSURE- This will occur if the
compressor is running and the following conditions are
met.The coolant must be less than 1 psi and eitherthe sump pressure is greater than 10 psi or the inletvacuum is less than 12 psi.
