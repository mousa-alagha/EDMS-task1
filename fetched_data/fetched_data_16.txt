Compressor Terminology 
AIR/OIL 
COALESCER Performs second stage separation of oil from compressed air feeding tools.  
Sometimes referred to as the separator cartridge or purifier cartridge. 
CFM Refers to the volume of compressed air being produced expressed as cubic 
feet of air per minute. 
SPEED CONTROL Sometimes referred to as the engine speed control 
OIL SUMP The first stage of oil separation from  compressed air.  Also serves as reservoir 
area for compressor lubricant, measured in rpm (revolutions per minute). 
PSI Refers to the operating pressure the system is set up at, expressed as pounds 
per square inch. 
PRESSURE RELIEF 
VALVE A valve located on the oil sump which opens in case of excessive pressure.  
Sometimes referred to as the pop-off valve or the check valve. 
HI-TEMP SHUTDOWN 
SWITCH Works in conjunction with a power relay, sending a signal to stop the 
compressor power source in cases of high compressor oil temperature.

Initial Start-up. 
Each Compressor Unit built is extensively tested at the factory before shipment. The Unit is shipped with 
the original oil in it as used for testing purposes. 
 Check the Oil level and for any Oil leaks on a daily 
basis. This must be done when the Unit is off. Top up 
the Oil level on a monthly basis.  
Use only DV Systems ‘ DEV-3000 ’ Synthetic Oil. Also,  
do not mix the ‘DEV-3000’ with any other lubricant. 
 
Subsequent Oil Changes. 
Drain the existing oil from the Unit. (Please be 
advised that the Unit cannot be drained fully of oil, as 
some oil may remain in various components ie 
Cooler, Tubing, etc.)  
Fill the Oil Reservoir to the Metal Band on the 
External Oil Level Gauge as shown below. Do not under or overfill. See drawing below. 
 
Use only DV Systems ‘ DEV-3000 ’ Synthetic Oil, 
available in both 1 US gallon (3.8 litre) jugs or 5 US 
gallon (5 x 3.8 litre) pails. Any remaining oil may be 
used for ‘top-ups’.‘ 
 
The ‘ MK-G20-30-1 ’ Maintenance Kit includes: 
(1) 5 US Gallon Oil (‘DEV-3000’) 
(2) Oil Filter (’DSC-624’) (1) Air/Oil Separator Filter (’DSC-001148’) 
(2) Air Filter (’DSC-001961’) 
(1) In Line Filter (‘DSC-612) 
 
The ‘MK-G20-30-1’ Kit is appropriate for Units of serial number ‘37162’ and higher. Use ‘MK-G20-30’ 
Kit for Units of serial number ‘37135’ and lower. 
 
Do not attempt to operate the Unit without first checking whether there is oil in the Oil 
Reservoir. Add oil as required. Serious 
damage may result from use, however 
limited, without oil. 
 
Use of improper oil may negatively affect 
Compressor performance or shorten Unit life. 
Resulting problems are not covered by the 
DV Systems Inc. Air Compressor Warranty. 
 
Condensation (water) may form in the Oil Reservoir with the oil. If this occurs, as the 
water will tend to settl e on the bottom of the 
Reservoir, drain the water from the Reservoir 
until you notice oil draining. Top up the Reservoir with new oil using only the DV 
Systems ‘DEV-3000’ oil. 
When running, 
oil level will be 
closer to bottom
